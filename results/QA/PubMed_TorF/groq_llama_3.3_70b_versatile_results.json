This suggests that PRK and ASA, and secondarily SBK, should be biomechanically safer than conventional LASIK with regard to risk for causing keratectasia after surgery. Because adult human corneal stromal wounds heal slowly and incompletely, all excimer laser keratorefractive surgical techniques still have some distinct disadvantages due to inadequate reparative wound healing. Despite reducing some of the risk for corneal haze compared to conventional PRK, ASA cases still can develop corneal haze or breakthrough haze from the hypercellular fibrotic stromal scarring.

A high CPAP was defined as the mean + 1 standard deviation (SD;>or =12 cm H2O). The predictor variables included apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). High CPAP was required in 2 (6.9%), 6 (5.8%), and 63 (28.6%) patients with mild, moderate, and severe OSA, respectively. On univariate analysis, AHI, BMI, ESS score, and the proportion of males were significantly higher in those needing high CPAP. They also have a lower MSLT mean. On logistic regression, the use of high CPAP was 5.90 times more frequent (95% confidence interval 2.67-13.1) in severe OSA patients after adjustment for the other variables.
