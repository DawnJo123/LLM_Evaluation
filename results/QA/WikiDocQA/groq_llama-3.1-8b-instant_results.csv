What causes Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura?,"ITP occurs when certain immune system cells produce antibodies against platelets. Platelets help your blood clot by clumping together to plug small holes in damaged blood vessels.
The antibodies attach to the platelets. The spleen destroys the platelets that carry the antibodies.
In children, the disease sometimes follows a viral infection. In adults, it is more often a chronic (long-term) disease and can occur after a viral infection, with use of certain drugs, during pregnancy, or as part of an immune disorder.
ITP affects women more frequently than men, and is more common in children than adults. The disease affects boys and girls equally.",Answer this question truthfully,"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), also known as immune thrombocytopenic purpura, is an autoimmune disorder characterized by low platelet count. The exact cause of ITP is not fully understood, but it is believed to result from a combination of factors, including:

1. **Autoantibody production**: The immune system mistakenly produces antibodies against platelets, marking them for destruction.
2. **Platelet destruction**: The spleen recognizes the antibody-coated platelets as foreign and removes them from the circulation, leading to a decrease in platelet count.
3. **Impaired platelet production**: In some cases, the bone marrow may not produce enough platelets to compensate for the increased destruction.

The exact trigger for the autoimmune response in ITP is unknown, but it is thought to be related to:

1. **Genetic predisposition**: Family history may play a role in the development of ITP.
2. **Viral infections**: Certain viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus, may trigger the autoimmune response.
3. **Other medical conditions**: Certain conditions, such as autoimmune disorders (e.g., lupus, rheumatoid arthritis), may increase the risk of developing ITP.

It's worth noting that ITP is a relatively rare condition, and the exact cause of each individual case may be unique.",1.422748327255249,0.3210702341137124,0.0606060606060606,0.18729096989966554,0.010651599879254365,0.27629213890557985,0.9564368724822998

The individuals at the highest risk for Ichthyosis vulgaris are:

1. **First-degree relatives**: Children of parents with Ichthyosis vulgaris are at a higher risk of developing the condition. Studies suggest that if one parent has Ichthyosis vulgaris, their child has a 50-70% chance of inheriting the condition.
2. **Family history**: Individuals with a family history of Ichthyosis vulgaris are more likely to develop the condition.
3. **Genetic predisposition**: Ichthyosis vulgaris is associated with mutations in the filaggrin gene (FLG). Individuals with a family history of atopic dermatitis (eczema) are also at higher risk, as atopic dermatitis and Ichthyosis vulgaris often coexist.

It's essential to note that while these individuals are at higher risk, not everyone with a family history will develop Ichthyosis vulgaris.",0.7349872589111328,0.19736842105263158,0.09333333333333332,0.19736842105263158,0.03951424460515394,0.3814728883733024,0.92415851354599
What causes Hydrocele?,"Hydroceles are common in newborn infants. During normal development, the testicles descend down a tube from the abdomen into the scrotum. Hydroceles result when this tube fails to close. Fluid drains from the abdomen through the open tube. The fluid builds up in the scrotum, where it becomes trapped. This causes the scrotum to become swollen. Hydroceles normally go away a few months after birth, but their appearance may worry new parents. Occasionally, a hydrocele may be associated with an inguinal hernia. Hydroceles may also be caused by inflammation or injury of the testicle or epididymis, or by fluid or blood blockage within the spermatic cord. This type of hydrocele is more common in older men.",Answer this question truthfully,"A hydrocele is a condition where fluid accumulates in a sac surrounding a testicle, causing it to swell. The main causes of hydrocele are:

1. **Congenital**: Hydrocele can be present at birth, often due to a patent processus vaginalis, which is a communication between the abdominal cavity and the scrotum.
2. **Injury**: Trauma to the testicle or scrotum can cause a hydrocele by damaging the surrounding tissue and allowing fluid to accumulate.
3. **Infection**: Infections such as epididymitis or orchitis can cause inflammation and lead to the formation of a hydrocele.
4. **Varicocele**: A varicocele is a swelling of the veins in the scrotum, which can cause fluid to accumulate and lead to a hydrocele.
5. **Aging**: Hydrocele can occur in older men due to the natural aging process, which can cause the tissue surrounding the testicle to weaken and allow fluid to accumulate.
6. **Tumors**: Rarely, a hydrocele can be caused by a tumor in the testicle or surrounding tissue.

It's worth noting that hydrocele is often a benign condition and may not require treatment. However, if the hydrocele is large or causing discomfort, treatment may be necessary to drain the fluid and relieve symptoms.",0.8560409545898438,0.3578274760383387,0.1157556270096463,0.1853035143769968,0.03914660994335792,0.2756542575457945,0.9720737338066101
What to expect if I have Impacted tooth  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"Impacted teeth may cause no problems for some people and may never require treatment. Treatment is usually successful when it does cause symptoms.
It is often preferable to have wisdom teeth removed before age 30 due to the flexibility of bone, which will allow an easier removal and better healing. As a person ages, the bone becomes more rigid and complications can develop.",Answer this question truthfully,"If you have an impacted tooth, the outlook or prognosis depends on several factors, including:

1. **Type of impacted tooth**: The prognosis is generally better for impacted wisdom teeth (third molars) than for impacted canines or premolars.
2. **Location and position**: Impacted teeth that are partially erupted or have a relatively simple path to eruption have a better prognosis than those that are deeply embedded or have a complex path to eruption.
3. **Age**: The younger the patient, the better the prognosis. Impacted teeth that are not treated can lead to complications, such as infection, cyst formation, or damage to surrounding teeth and bone.
4. **Presence of complications**: If the impacted tooth is associated with a cyst, abscess, or other complications, the prognosis is generally poorer.

**Possible outcomes:**

1. **Successful eruption**: With proper treatment, the impacted tooth may erupt normally, and the patient can maintain good oral health.
2. **Surgical removal**: If the impacted tooth is not likely to erupt or is causing problems, it may need to be surgically removed.
3. **Cyst formation**: If the impacted tooth is associated with a cyst, it may need to be surgically removed, and the cyst may need to be drained or removed.
4. **Infection or abscess**: If the impacted tooth becomes infected or forms an abscess, it may need to be surgically removed, and antibiotics may be prescribed to treat the infection.
5. **Damage to surrounding teeth and bone**: If the impacted tooth is not treated, it can lead to damage to surrounding teeth and bone, which may require additional surgical procedures.

What are the causes of Irritable bowel syndrome ?,"Researchers have yet to discover any specific cause for IBS. One theory is that people who suffer from IBS have a colon, or large intestine, that is particularly sensitive and reactive to certain foods and stress. The immune system, which fights infection, may also be involved.
Normal motility, or movement, may not be present in the colon of a person who has IBS. It can be spasmodic or can even stop working temporarily. Spasms are sudden strong muscle contractions that come and go. The lining of the colon called the epithelium, which is affected by the immune and nervous systems, regulates the flow of fluids in and out of the colon. In IBS, the epithelium appears to work properly. However, when the contents inside the colon move too quickly, the colon loses its ability to absorb fluids. The result is too much fluid in the stool. In other people, the movement inside the colon is too slow, which causes extra fluid to be absorbed. As a result, a person develops constipation. A person’s colon may respond strongly to stimuli such as certain foods or stress that would not bother most people. Recent research has reported that serotonin is linked with normal gastrointestinal (GI) functioning. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter, or chemical, that delivers messages from one part of your body to another. Ninety-five percent of the serotonin in your body is located in the GI tract, and the other 5 percent is found in the brain. Cells that line the inside of the bowel work as transporters and carry the serotonin out of the GI tract. People with IBS, however, have diminished receptor activity, causing abnormal levels of serotonin to exist in the GI tract. As a result, they experience problems with bowel movement, motility, and sensation—having more sensitive pain receptors in their GI tract. Researchers have reported that IBS may be caused by a bacterial infection in the gastrointestinal tract. Studies show that people who have had gastroenteritis sometimes develop IBS, otherwise called post-infectious IBS. Researchers have also found very mild celiac disease in some people with symptoms similar to IBS. People with celiac disease cannot digest gluten, a substance found in wheat, rye, and barley. People with celiac disease cannot eat these foods without becoming very sick because their immune system responds by damaging the small intestine. A blood test can determine whether celiac disease may be present.",Answer this question truthfully,"Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a complex condition with multiple potential causes and contributing factors. The exact cause of IBS is still not fully understood, but several factors are thought to play a role:

1. **Abnormal gut motility**: IBS is characterized by abnormal muscle contractions in the intestines, leading to changes in bowel habits.
2. **Sensitivity to food**: Certain foods, such as gluten, dairy, high-FODMAP foods (e.g., beans, cabbage, broccoli), and spicy or fatty foods, can trigger IBS symptoms.
3. **Stress and anxiety**: Stress and anxiety can exacerbate IBS symptoms and contribute to the development of the condition.
4. **Hormonal changes**: Hormonal fluctuations during menstruation, pregnancy, or menopause can affect bowel habits and contribute to IBS.
5. **Gut microbiome imbalance**: An imbalance of the gut microbiome, also known as dysbiosis, may contribute to IBS symptoms.
6. **Genetic predisposition**: IBS tends to run in families, suggesting a possible genetic component.
7. **Infections**: Certain infections, such as gastroenteritis, can trigger IBS symptoms in some individuals.
8. **Medications**: Certain medications, such as antibiotics, antihistamines, and painkillers, can alter gut motility and contribute to IBS.
9. **Other medical conditions**: Conditions like celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and gastroparesis can coexist with IBS and contribute to symptoms.
10. **Neurological factors**: IBS may be related to changes in the brain-gut axis, including altered gut-brain communication and stress response.

For incomplete androgen insensitivity syndrome patients, it depends on the presence and severity of ambiguous genitalia.",Answer this question truthfully,"Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS) is a genetic condition where an individual is genetically male (46,XY) but resistant to male hormones (androgens). This results in the development of female external genitalia, despite the presence of testes.

**Outlook/Prognosis:**

The outlook for individuals with AIS is generally good, with a normal life expectancy. However, the prognosis depends on various factors, including:

1. **Genetic type**: There are three types of AIS: complete, partial, and mild. Complete AIS is the most common and severe form, while mild AIS may have a milder presentation.
2. **Surgical interventions**: Individuals with AIS may require surgical interventions, such as orchiectomy (removal of testes) and vaginoplasty (creation of a vagina), which can improve quality of life and reduce the risk of complications.
3. **Hormone replacement therapy**: Individuals with AIS may require hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to manage symptoms and prevent osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and other health issues associated with estrogen deficiency.
4. **Psychological support**: Individuals with AIS may experience psychological challenges, such as gender dysphoria, anxiety, and depression. Access to psychological support and counseling can improve mental health outcomes.

**Potential complications:**

1. **Infertility**: Individuals with AIS are typically infertile due to the absence of a uterus and ovaries.
2. **Osteoporosis**: Estrogen deficiency can lead to osteoporosis, increasing the risk of fractures.
3. **Cardiovascular disease**: Estrogen deficiency can also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.
4. **Cancer risk**: Individuals with AIS have an increased risk of developing breast cancer due to the presence of breast tissue.

Risk factors for liver disease include alcoholic cirrhosis and other diseases that lead to cirrhosis, such as viral hepatitis (Hepatitis B or C). Spontaneous peritonitis also occurs in patients who are on dialysis for kidney failure.",Answer this question truthfully,"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a complication that occurs in patients with cirrhosis, particularly those with ascites. The exact cause of SBP is not fully understood, but several factors contribute to its development:

1. **Portal hypertension**: Elevated portal pressure leads to increased blood flow through the liver, causing portal blood to bypass the liver's filtering function and enter the peritoneal cavity.
2. **Bacterial translocation**: Bacteria from the gut, particularly from the small intestine, can translocate into the peritoneal cavity through the gut-liver axis or via the lymphatic system.
3. **Impaired immune function**: Patients with cirrhosis often have impaired immune function, making it difficult for the body to clear bacteria from the peritoneal cavity.
4. **Increased gut permeability**: Cirrhosis can lead to increased gut permeability, allowing bacteria and toxins to pass through the gut wall and into the bloodstream.
5. **Hypoalbuminemia**: Low albumin levels, often seen in cirrhosis, can lead to decreased oncotic pressure, allowing fluid to accumulate in the peritoneal cavity and increasing the risk of SBP.

These factors create a fertile ground for bacterial growth in the peritoneal cavity, leading to SBP. The most common bacteria responsible for SBP are Gram-negative rods, such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.",5.458080768585205,0.25190839694656486,0.053846153846153856,0.1450381679389313,0.031297455221527486,0.299805691429913,0.9575377702713013

Who is at risk for Emphysema?,"Patients with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (A1AD) are more likely to suffer from emphysema. A1AD allows inflammatory enzymes (such as elastase) to destroy the alveolar tissue. Most A1AD patients do not develop clinically significant emphysema, but smoking and severely decreased A1AT levels (10-15%) can cause emphysema at a young age. The type of emphysema caused by A1AD is known as panacinar emphysema (involving the entire acinus) as opposed to centrilobular emphysema, which is caused by smoking. Panacinar emphysema typically affects the lower lungs, while centrilobular emphysema affects the upper lungs. A1AD causes about 2% of all emphysema. Smokers with A1AD are at the greatest risk for emphysema. Mild emphysema can often develop into a severe case over a short period of time (1–2 weeks).",Answer this question truthfully,"Emphysema is a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that affects the lungs. The following individuals are at higher risk for developing emphysema:

1. **Smokers**: Smoking is the leading cause of emphysema, accounting for about 80-90% of cases. Smoking damages the air sacs in the lungs, leading to breathlessness and other symptoms.
2. **Exposure to air pollution**: Long-term exposure to air pollution, such as particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide, can increase the risk of emphysema.
3. **Genetic predisposition**: Individuals with a family history of emphysema or COPD are more likely to develop the disease.
4. **Age**: Emphysema is more common in people over 40 years old.
5. **Occupational exposure**: Workers in industries that involve exposure to dust, chemicals, or other lung irritants, such as coal miners, construction workers, or factory workers, are at higher risk.
6. **Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency**: This is a rare genetic disorder that can increase the risk of emphysema, especially in young people.
7. **Chronic bronchitis**: Individuals with chronic bronchitis are at higher risk of developing emphysema.
8. **Asthma**: People with asthma are more likely to develop emphysema, especially if they have a history of smoking or exposure to lung irritants.

It's essential to note that emphysema can affect anyone, regardless of age or background.

The formatting you're referring to is called Markdown, a lightweight markup language used to format plain text. In Markdown, equal signs (`=`) are used to create headers, which can be used to organize and structure text into sections, subsections, and sub-subsections.

**Why Use Markdown Formatting?**

1. **Easy to Read and Write**: Markdown is simple and easy to read and write, making it a great choice for creating formatted text.
2. **Platform Independent**: Markdown can be used on any platform, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, without the need for specialized software.
3. **Flexible**: Markdown can be used to create a wide range of documents, from simple notes to complex reports.
4. **Search Engine Friendly**: Markdown formatted text is easily searchable by search engines, making it a great choice for creating content that needs to be indexed.

**How to Use Equal Signs in Markdown**

1. **Headers**: Use one or more equal signs (`=`) to create headers. For example:
```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```
2. **Subheadings**: Use multiple equal signs (`=`) to create subheadings. For example:
```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
```
3. **Sub-subheadings**: Use multiple equal signs (`=`) to create sub-subheadings. For example:
```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5

How does the balance system work?,"Movement of fluid in the semicircular canals signals the brain about the direction and speed of rotation of the head--for example, whether we are nodding our head up and down or looking from right to left. Each semicircular canal has a bulbed end, or enlarged portion, that contains hair cells. Rotation of the head causes a flow of fluid, which in turn causes displacement of the top portion of the hair cells that are embedded in the jelly-like cupula. Two other organs that are part of the vestibular system are the utricle and saccule. These are called the otolithic organs and are responsible for detecting linear acceleration, or movement in a straight line. The hair cells of the otolithic organs are blanketed with a jelly-like layer studded with tiny calcium stones called otoconia. When the head is tilted or the body position is changed with respect to gravity, the displacement of the stones causes the hair cells to bend.
The balance system works with the visual and skeletal systems (the muscles and joints and their sensors) to maintain orientation or balance. For example, visual signals are sent to the brain about the body's position in relation to its surroundings. These signals are processed by the brain, and compared to information from the vestibular and the skeletal systems. An example of interaction between the visual and vestibular systems is called the vestibular-ocular reflex. The nystagmus (an involuntary rhythmic eye movement) that occurs when a person is spun around and then suddenly stops is an example of a vestibular-ocular reflex.",Answer this question truthfully,"The balance system, also known as the vestibular system, is a complex network of sensory receptors and pathways that help maintain our balance, posture, and spatial orientation. It consists of three main components:

1. **Vestibular apparatus**: Located in the inner ear, it includes three semicircular canals and the otolith organs (utricle and saccule). These structures contain sensory hair cells that detect changes in head position, movement, and acceleration.
2. **Vestibular nerve**: The vestibular apparatus sends signals to the brain through the vestibular nerve, which is a branch of the eighth cranial nerve (vestibulocochlear nerve).
3. **Brainstem and cerebellum**: The vestibular nerve sends signals to the brainstem, specifically the vestibular nuclei, and the cerebellum, which process and integrate this information to maintain balance and posture.

Here's how it works:

1. **Sensory input**: The vestibular apparatus detects changes in head position, movement, and acceleration, sending signals to the vestibular nerve.
2. **Signal transmission**: The vestibular nerve transmits these signals to the brainstem and cerebellum.
3. **Processing and integration**: The brainstem and cerebellum process and integrate this information with visual and proprioceptive (sensory input from muscles and joints) information to maintain balance and posture.
4. **Motor response**: The brain sends signals to muscles and joints to make adjustments to maintain balance and posture.

The balance system helps us:

* Maintain posture and balance
* Orient ourselves in space
* Make adjustments for movement and changes in head position
* Prevent falls and injuries

Dysfunction of the balance system can lead to conditions such as vertigo, dizziness, and balance disorders.",1.6572608947753906,0.41005802707930367,0.10485436893203884,0.20116054158607352,0.036908089757175404,0.26252475310771267,0.9716373085975647

What to expect if I have Floater  (Outlook/Prognosis)?,"In most cases, floaters are part of the natural aging process and simply an annoyance. They can be distracting at first, but eventually tend to ""settle"" at the bottom of the eye, becoming less bothersome. They usually settle below the line of sight but do not go away completely.
Sometimes a section of the vitreous pulls the fine fibers away from the retina all at once, rather than gradually, causing many new floaters to appear suddenly. This is called a vitreous detachment, which in most cases is not sight-threatening and requires no treatment.
However, a sudden increase in floaters, possibly accompanied by light flashes or peripheral (side) vision loss, could indicate a retinal detachment. If left untreated, a retinal detachment can lead to permanent visual impairment within two or three days or even blindness in the eye.",Answer this question truthfully,"Floater, also known as floaters, are small, shadowy spots that appear to float in your field of vision. They are usually caused by the aging process, where the vitreous gel in the eye becomes more liquid and clumps of cells form, casting shadows on the retina.

The outlook or prognosis for floaters is generally good, and most people can adapt to living with them. However, in some cases, floaters can be a symptom of a more serious underlying condition, such as:

1. **Vitreomacular traction**: A condition where the vitreous gel pulls on the macula, causing vision problems.
2. **Retinal detachment**: A condition where the retina separates from the back of the eye, which can cause sudden vision loss.
3. **Diabetic retinopathy**: A condition that can cause blood vessels in the retina to become damaged, leading to vision problems.

If you have floaters, you can expect the following:

1. **Gradual improvement**: In most cases, floaters will become less noticeable over time as your brain adapts to them.
2. **No significant vision loss**: Floaters are usually not a cause of significant vision loss, but they can be annoying and affect your quality of life.
3. **Treatment options**: In some cases, treatment may be necessary to address underlying conditions, such as laser surgery or vitrectomy (surgical removal of the vitreous gel).
4. **Regular eye exams**: It's essential to have regular eye exams to monitor the condition of your eyes and address any potential complications.

If you experience any of the following symptoms, seek medical attention immediately:

* Sudden vision loss
* Flashes of light
* A curtain or shadow in your vision

Other possible causes include tetralogy of Fallot, infective endocarditis, and congenital absence of the pulmonary valve, carcinoid syndrome.",Answer this question truthfully,"Pulmonic regurgitation (PR) is a condition where the pulmonary valve, which separates the right ventricle from the pulmonary artery, leaks or fails to close properly. This allows blood to flow back from the pulmonary artery into the right ventricle during diastole (the relaxation phase of the heart).

Causes of pulmonic regurgitation include:

1. **Pulmonary valve damage**: Trauma, endocarditis, or rheumatic heart disease can damage the pulmonary valve, leading to regurgitation.
2. **Pulmonary hypertension**: High blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries can cause the pulmonary valve to become incompetent, leading to regurgitation.
3. **Congenital heart defects**: Certain congenital heart defects, such as tetralogy of Fallot or pulmonary atresia, can cause pulmonic regurgitation.
4. **Right ventricular dysfunction**: Weakening of the right ventricle can lead to pulmonic regurgitation.

What are the symptoms of Bornholm disease?,"Symptoms may include fever and headache, but the distinguishing characteristic of this disease is attacks of severe pain in the lower chest, often on one side.  The slightest movement of the rib cage causes a sharp increase of pain, which makes it very difficult to breathe, and an attack is therefore quite a frightening experience, although it generally passes off before any actual harm occurs. The attacks are unpredictable and strike ""out of the blue"" with a feeling like an iron grip around the rib cage. The colloquial names for the disease, such as'The Devil's grip' reflect this symptom.
Once inside the body, the coxsackie viruses multiply in the throat and intestines then spread into the bloodstream. At this point, the body's immune defenses often can limit the infection and prevent the person from developing symptoms. If the immune defenses are less successful, the person develops a fever or other symptoms, such as headache, nausea and vomiting, and sore throat. Only a few infected people develop the classic muscle pain in the chest and upper abdomen that gives the disease its name. In these people, the coxsackie virus infection has settled in the muscles of the chest and upper abdomen, causing inflammation there. The chest pain usually feels worse with deep breathing, called pleuritic pain. It can be a severe, stabbing pain or it can be a milder cramping in the side. Usually, only one side of the chest or abdomen is affected, although occasionally the pain can include muscles of the neck or arms.

2. **High blood pressure**: Uncontrolled high blood pressure can cause the arterial walls to become damaged, leading to plaque buildup and stenosis.
3. **Smoking**: Smoking damages the inner lining of the arteries, making them more susceptible to plaque buildup and stenosis.
4. **High cholesterol**: Elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol can contribute to plaque buildup and stenosis.
5. **Diabetes**: People with diabetes are more likely to develop atherosclerosis and carotid artery stenosis due to high blood sugar levels and inflammation.
6. **Age**: Carotid artery stenosis is more common in people over 60 years old, as the risk of atherosclerosis increases with age.
7. **Family history**: A family history of carotid artery stenosis or other cardiovascular diseases can increase the risk of developing the condition.
8. **Inflammation**: Chronic inflammation in the body can contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and carotid artery stenosis.
9. **Genetic predisposition**: Certain genetic conditions, such as familial hypercholesterolemia, can increase the risk of developing carotid artery stenosis.

What to expect before Mitral valve surgery (minimally invasive)?,"Always tell your doctor or nurse:
If you are or could be pregnant What drugs you are taking, even drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.
You may be able to store blood in the blood bank for transfusions during and after your surgery. Ask your surgeon about how you and your family members can donate blood.
For the 2-week period before surgery, you may be asked to stop taking drugs that make it harder for your blood to clot. These might cause increased bleeding during the surgery.
Some of them are aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). If you are taking warfarin (Coumadin) or clopidogrel (Plavix), talk with your surgeon before stopping or changing how you take these drugs.
Prepare your house for when you get home from the hospital.
The day before your surgery, shower and shampoo well. You may be asked to wash your whole body below your neck with a special soap. Scrub your chest two or three times with this soap. You also may be asked to take an antibiotic to guard against infection.
During the days before your surgery:
Ask your doctor which drugs you should still take on the day of your surgery. If you smoke, you must stop. Ask your doctor for help. Always let your doctor know if you have a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or any other illness in the time leading up to your surgery.
On the day of the surgery:
You will usually be asked not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before your surgery. This includes chewing gum and using breath mints.

How is Mitral valve surgery (minimally invasive) done?,"Before your surgery you will receive general anesthesia. This will make you unconscious and unable to feel pain.
There are several different ways to perform minimally invasive mitral valve surgery.
Your heart surgeon may make a 2-inch to 3-inch-long cut in the right part of your chest near the sternum (breastbone). Muscles in the area will be divided so your surgeon can reach the heart. A small cut is made in the left side of your heart so the surgeon can repair or replace the mitral valve. In endoscopic surgery, your surgeon makes one to four small holes in your chest. Then your surgeon uses special instruments and a camera to do the surgery. For robotically-assisted valve surgery, the surgeon makes two to four tiny cuts (about Â½ to Â¾ inch) in your chest. The surgeon uses a special computer to control robotic arms during the surgery. The surgeon sees a three-dimensional view of the heart and mitral valve on the computer. This method is very precise.
You may or may not need to be on a heart lung machine for these types of surgery, but if not, your heart rate will be slowed by medicine or a mechanical device.
If your surgeon can repair your mitral valve, you may have:
Ring annuloplasty -- The surgeon repairs the ring-like part around the valve by sewing a ring of metal, cloth, or tissue around the valve. Valve repair -- The surgeon trims, shapes, or rebuilds one or both of the leaflets of the valve. The leaflets are flaps that open and close the valve.
If your mitral valve is too damaged, you will need a new valve. This is called valve replacement surgery. Your surgeon will remove your mitral valve and sew a new one into place. There are two main types of new valves:
Mechanical -- made of man-made materials, such as titanium, or ceramic. These valves last the longest, but you will need to take blood thinning medicine, such as warfarin (Coumadin) or aspirin, for the rest of your life. Biological -- made of human or animal tissue. These valves last 10 - 12 years, but you may not need to take blood thinners for life.
The surgery may take 2 -4 hours.
This surgery can also be done through a groin artery, with no cuts on your chest. The doctor sends a catheter (flexible tube) with a balloon attached on the end. The balloon stretches the opening of the valve. This procedure is called percutaneous valvuloplasty.",Answer this question truthfully,"Minimally invasive mitral valve surgery is a type of surgical procedure that uses smaller incisions and advanced technology to repair or replace the mitral valve. Here's a step-by-step overview of the procedure:

**Preparation:**

1. The patient is placed under general anesthesia.
2. The surgical team uses imaging techniques, such as echocardiography and fluoroscopy, to visualize the mitral valve.
3. The patient is positioned on a specialized table that allows for easy access to the chest.

**Incisions:**

1. The surgeon makes 2-4 small incisions (about 1-2 inches long) in the chest, usually in the right side or below the breastbone.
2. One incision is used for the camera and light source, while the others are used for the surgical instruments.

**Surgical Steps:**

1. The surgeon uses a thoracoscope (a thin, flexible tube with a camera and light) to visualize the mitral valve.
2. The surgeon makes a small incision in the pericardium (the sac surrounding the heart) to access the mitral valve.
3. The surgeon uses specialized instruments to repair or replace the mitral valve, depending on the patient's condition.
4. The surgeon may use a minimally invasive mitral valve repair technique, such as:
	* Annuloplasty (repairing the valve ring)
	* Leaflet repair (repairing the valve leaflets)
	* Chordal repair (repairing the strings that support the valve leaflets)
5. If a replacement is necessary, the surgeon may use a minimally invasive mitral valve replacement technique, such as:
	* Transapical approach (inserting the new valve through the apex of the heart)
	* Transseptal approach (inserting the new valve through the septum between the atria)

**Closure:**

1. The surgeon closes the incisions in the pericardium and the chest wall.
2. The patient is taken to the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring and recovery.

**Benefits:**

Minimally invasive mitral valve surgery offers several benefits, including:

* Smaller incisions and less tissue damage
* Less pain and discomfort
* Shorter hospital stay (usually 2-5 days)
* Faster recovery time (usually 2-6 weeks)
* Reduced risk of complications and scarring

However, minimally invasive surgery may not be suitable for all patients, and the surgeon will determine the best approach based on the individual's condition and needs.",5.513343811035156,0.45559845559845563,0.17290322580645162,0.20592020592020593,0.0754745535288163,0.2514482180917095,0.9589919447898865

Who is at highest risk for Lyme disease ?,"Individuals who spend time outdoors and/or have pets that go outdoors in endemic regions are at risk for tick-borne disease.
Exposure to ticks: Individuals with frequent exposure to dogs and who reside near wooded areas or areas with high grass may also be at increased risk of tick-borne infection. Individuals with outdoor occupations and who work outside with bare or exposed skin are at a high risk of contracting Lyme disease. Failing to remove a tick as soon as you see it on your skin (the longer a tick is attached to your skin, the greater your risk of developing Lyme disease) also increases risk of developing Lyme disease.
Endemic Regions: About 95% of all reported cases are confined to 14 states including Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Any individual traveling or living within these five geographic areas including New England, Mid-Atlantic, East-North Central, South Atlantic, and West North-Central is at a heightened risk of exposure to Lyme disease.
Seasonal Variation: The majority of Lyme disease cases are reported during the summer months of May to August. Case incidence increases in May, peaks in June and July, and tapers off in August.
Rarer forms of Transmission: Cases of blood transfusion and organ transplantation have been recorded as methods of transmission but transmission through this avenue is rare.",Answer this question truthfully,"According to established medical knowledge, individuals at the highest risk for Lyme disease are:

What are the symptoms of gallbladder cancer?,"Because the gallbladder is located deep inside the body, your doctor cannot see or feel tumors during a routine physical exam. Therefore, it is hard to diagnose gallbladder cancer early. Sometimes, gallbladder cancers are found unexpectedly after removal of the gallbladder for other reasons, such as gallstones. As the cancer progresses, people may notice one or more symptoms as the following:
Jaundice: Is a yellowing of the sclera and skin. Normally, bilirubin is made in the liver and the liver excretes it into bile. Then bile goes into the intestines eventually leaving the body in the stool. Once the common bile duct becomes blocked, bile can't reach the intestines, and the level of bilirubin builds up. If the bile duct is blocked, bilirubin cannot get through to the intestines then stools may become lighter in color. Abdominal pain: Experiencing abdominal pain due to gallbladder cancer is because advanced gallbladder cancer start to compress other nearby organs. The pain may be constant or it may come and go. Gallbladder enlargement or lump in abdomen: Is because the cancer blocks the bile duct and bile builds up in the gallbladder to enlarge. Sometimes a doctor can feel this enlargement during the physical exam Digestive problems: Patients with gallbladder cancer are unable to digest fatty foods when cancer blocks the release of the bile into the intestine. This can cause nausea and vomiting that tend to be worse after eating. Undigested fat may cause stools to be pale, bulky, and greasy. Weight loss and marasmus, poor appetite: Unintended or unexpected weight loss is very common in patients with gallbladder cancer. These people also complain of being very tired and having little or no appetite.
Other health problems such as gallstones, hepatitis, and other pancreatic diseases may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell his/her doctor so that problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible.",Answer this question truthfully,"Gallbladder cancer symptoms can be non-specific and may resemble those of gallstones or other gallbladder conditions.

Why this medication is prescribed?,"Pravastatin is used together with lifestyle changes (diet, weight-loss, exercise) to reduce the amount of cholesterol (a fat-like substance) and other fatty substances in the blood. Pravastatin is in a class of medications called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). It works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body.
Buildup of cholesterol and other fats along the walls of the blood vessels (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body. Lowering blood levels of cholesterol and other fats may help to decrease your chances of getting heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks. In addition to taking a cholesterol-lowering medication, making certain changes in your daily habits can also lower your cholesterol blood levels.

How is the ELISA done?,"Blood is typically drawn from a vein, usually from the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. The site is cleaned with germ-killing medicine (antiseptic). The health care provider wraps an elastic band around the upper arm to apply pressure to the area and make the vein swell with blood.
Next, the health care provider gently inserts a needle into the vein. The blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle. The elastic band is removed from your arm.
Once the blood has been collected, the needle is removed, and the puncture site is covered to stop any bleeding.
In infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin and make it bleed. The blood collects into a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip. A bandage may be placed over the area if there is any bleeding.
The sample is sent to a laboratory where the targeted antibody (or antigen) is linked to an enzyme. If the target substance is in the sample, the test solution turns a different color. When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain, while others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.",Answer this question truthfully,"ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) is a laboratory technique used to detect and quantify specific antibodies or antigens in a sample. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the ELISA process:

**Preparation:**

1. **Coating**: A microtiter plate is coated with a specific antigen or antibody that will bind to the target molecule.
2. **Blocking**: The plate is blocked with a protein solution to prevent non-specific binding of other molecules.

**Sample Preparation:**

1. **Sample collection**: A sample (e.g., blood, serum, or tissue) is collected from the patient.
2. **Sample preparation**: The sample is diluted and prepared according to the specific ELISA protocol.

**ELISA Procedure:**

1. **Sample addition**: The prepared sample is added to the coated microtiter plate wells.
2. **Antibody addition**: An enzyme-linked antibody (e.g., horseradish peroxidase) specific to the target molecule is added to the wells.
3. **Incubation**: The plate is incubated at a controlled temperature (usually 37°C) for a specified time (usually 1-2 hours) to allow the antibody to bind to the target molecule.
4. **Washing**: The plate is washed to remove unbound antibody and other molecules.
5. **Substrate addition**: A substrate (e.g., tetramethylbenzidine) is added to the wells, which reacts with the enzyme to produce a colored product.
6. **Incubation**: The plate is incubated for a specified time (usually 10-30 minutes) to allow the reaction to occur.
7. **Stopping**: The reaction is stopped by adding a stopping solution (e.g., sulfuric acid).
8. **Reading**: The plate is read using a spectrophotometer to measure the absorbance of the colored product.

**Interpretation:**

1. **Positive result**: A positive result is indicated by a high absorbance value, which suggests the presence of the target molecule.
2. **Negative result**: A negative result is indicated by a low absorbance value, which suggests the absence of the target molecule.

ELISA is a widely used technique for detecting and quantifying specific molecules in various fields, including immunology, virology, and molecular biology.",5.362557649612427,0.3229357798165137,0.051565377532228354,0.1688073394495413,0.007908650616964717,0.23022651318232454,0.9317933320999146

How to do Exposure Therapy?,"Some of the rules for constructing a good program of Exposure Therapy are:
The subject should have a final goal which should represent non-phobic behavior. This might be (for example) to hold a large snake and rub it against their cheek for several minutes. They should also have in mind a series of intermediate steps such that once they have partially habituated to one step the next is close enough to it that they can readily move on. Such a sequence is called a hierarchy. It may be explicit, in the form of a list of increasingly challenging tasks, or implicit, in the form of a set of principles for escalating the exposure. The therapist will decide which of these will be more useful for the subject. (A useful way of constructing such a hierarchy is the Method of Factors. At every stage the subjects self-exposure should be completely voluntary - a criterion that may be derived from the theory of cognitive dissonance. One important corollary of this principle is that, at every moment, the subject must have an easy way of terminating the exposure. By choosing not to escape - and therefore practising a competing response - the subject thereby weakens the arousal-escape connection. The arousal experienced at any point should be the maximum that the subject is prepared to accept (this is the main difference between Exposure Therapy and Systematic desensitization). It's useful if at each stage the subject asks themselves ""is there anything more I could do?"" By considering which factors they can manipulate they should be able to keep moving smoothly up their hierarchy. Research by Marks and Rachmann citation needed demonstrated that optimum results are obtained with daily practice lasting at least an hour; and that the daily session should be ended by allowing the level of arousal to fall off to around half its peak value. For this reason it's useful for the subject to keep a note of their arousal level on a 0-8 scale (where 0=no arousal and 8=intolerable arousal). Before this fall-off phase the level of arousal should be maintained at an uncomfortable but tolerable level.",Answer this question truthfully,"Exposure therapy is a type of psychotherapy used to treat anxiety disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social anxiety disorder, and specific phobias. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do exposure therapy:

**Preparation**

1. **Establish a therapeutic relationship**: Develop a strong rapport with your therapist or healthcare provider.
2. **Identify the target fear**: Clearly define the specific fear or anxiety-provoking situation you want to address.
3. **Set goals**: Collaborate with your therapist to set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals for the exposure therapy.

**Exposure Therapy Steps**

1. **Hierarchy creation**: Create a hierarchy of situations that trigger anxiety, ranging from mildly to extremely distressing. This hierarchy will serve as a guide for the exposure process.
2. **Initial exposure**: Start with the least distressing situation on the hierarchy. This may involve imagining, thinking about, or engaging in a small aspect of the feared situation.
3. **Gradual exposure**: Gradually increase the intensity or duration of the exposure, while maintaining a safe and controlled environment.
4. **Processing and reflection**: After each exposure, process and reflect on your experiences with your therapist. Discuss any thoughts, feelings, or physical sensations that arose during the exposure.
5. **Reframing and coping skills**: Learn new coping skills and reframe negative thoughts associated with the feared situation.
6. **Progressive exposure**: Continue to work through the hierarchy, gradually increasing the intensity or duration of the exposure.

**Key Principles**

1. **Safety**: Ensure a safe and controlled environment for the exposure.
2. **Gradual progression**: Gradually increase the intensity or duration of the exposure.
3. **Processing and reflection**: Regularly process and reflect on your experiences with your therapist.
4. **Coping skills**: Learn new coping skills and reframe negative thoughts associated with the feared situation.

**Important Considerations**

1. **Seek professional guidance**: Exposure therapy should be conducted under the guidance of a trained therapist or healthcare provider.
2. **Be patient**: Exposure therapy can be a time-consuming process, requiring patience and commitment.
3. **Monitor progress**: Regularly monitor your progress and adjust the exposure hierarchy as needed.

Remember, exposure therapy is a highly individualized and tailored approach.
