183. Decrease in Invasive Pneumococcal Disease in 7 United States Children’s Hospitals during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"BACKGROUND: During the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, physical distancing and mask use guidelines were implemented resulting in a decline in the number of infections caused by influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and otitis media. A surveillance analysis from England and Taiwan showed a decline in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) (Clin Infect Dis. 2021;72: e65-75 and J Infect. 2021;82:296-297). We hypothesized that COVID mitigation efforts resulted in a decrease in incidence of pediatric IPD within the U.S. during 2020 compared to previous years. METHODS: We reviewed all cases of IPD among 7 children’s hospitals from the U.S. Pediatric Multicenter Pneumococcal Surveillance Group from 2017-2020. IPD was defined by the isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from normally sterile sites (eg. blood, cerebrospinal, pleural, synovial or peritoneal fluid). Pneumococcal pneumonia was defined as an abnormal chest radiograph in the presence of a positive blood, pleural fluid or lung culture. Mastoiditis was identified by positive middle ear, subperiosteal abscess or mastoid bone culture. Serotypes were determined by the capsular swelling method. Hospital admission numbers were obtained for incidence calculations. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA11. A p< 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 410 IPD cases were identified. The cumulative incidence of IPD (0-22 years of age) decreased from 99.2/100,000 admissions in 2017-2019 to 53.8/100,000 admissions in 2020 (risk ratio 0.54, CI: 0.40-0.72, p< 0.00001). Pneumococcal bacteremia and pneumonia decreased significantly in 2020 (p< 0.05), and although not statistically significant, there were fewer cases of meningitis and mastoiditis when compared to previous years (p=0.08) (Figure 1). Sex, race, age or presence of comorbidities were not significantly different between groups. Most common serotypes in 2020 were 35B, 3 and 15B/C (Figure 2). [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The observed decline in IPD cases during the first year of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is likely associated with mask use and physical distancing limiting transmission of S. pneumoniae via droplets and viral infections frequently preceding IPD. These precautions might be useful in the future to decrease IPD, especially in high-risk patients. DISCLOSURES: Sheldon L. Kaplan, MD, Pfizer (Research Grant or Support) Tina Q.

CD10 in the developing human kidney: immunoreactivity and possible role in renal embryogenesis.,"CD10 was first identified in tumor cells of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Most studies on CD10 expression have dealt with tumor pathology. Since no data are available for specific role in the fetal kidney, this study aimed at investigating CD10 expression during the different phases of renal embryogenesis. To this end, the expression of CD10 was evaluated in the kidney of two human fetus and in three newborns. In both fetuses, immunostaining for CD10 was compartmentalized and mainly concentrated in the mid-deep cortex. Reactivity for CD10 was stronger in the glomerular epithelium, in proximal tubules and in metanephric mesenchymal cells. At 25 weeks of gestation, CD10 was also detected in the subcapsular regions, including some pretubular aggregates of cap mesenchymal cells and renal vesicles. At 34 weeks of gestation, we observed an increased immunoreactivity for CD10 in visceral and parietal glomerular epithelium. At 39 weeks of gestation, CD10 was also expressed in the collecting tubules and in the Henle loops. Our data show a strong expression of CD10 in all stage of human kidney development, characterized by dynamic changes and support the hypothesis that CD10 plays a relevant role in renal embryogenesis.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""CD10 Expression in Human Kidney Development: A Study of Renal Embryogenesis""",0.523392915725708,0.5833333333333334,0.1818181818181818,0.4999999999999999,0.045745633339932534,0.4236577181208054,0.9569613933563232
Long-term bone and lung consequences associated with hospital-acquired severe acute respiratory syndrome: a 15-year follow-up from a prospective cohort study.,"The most severe sequelae after rehabilitation from SARS are femoral head necrosis and pulmonary fibrosis. We performed a 15-year follow-up on the lung and bone conditions of SARS patients. We evaluated the recovery from lung damage and femoral head necrosis in an observational cohort study of SARS patients using pulmonary CT scans, hip joint MRI examinations, pulmonary function tests and hip joint function questionnaires. Eighty medical staff contracted SARS in 2003. Two patients died of SARS, and 78 were enrolled in this study from August 2003 to March 2018. Seventy-one patients completed the 15-year follow-up. The percentage of pulmonary lesions on CT scans diminished from 2003 (9.40 ± 7.83)% to 2004 (3.20 ± 4.78)% (P < 0.001) and remained stable thereafter until 2018 (4.60 ± 6.37)%. Between 2006 and 2018, the proportion of patients with interstitial changes who had improved pulmonary function was lower than that of patients without lesions, as demonstrated by the one-second ratio (FEV1/FVC%, t = 2.21, P = 0.04) and mid-flow of maximum expiration (FEF25%-75%, t = 2.76, P = 0.01). The volume of femoral head necrosis decreased significantly from 2003 (38.83 ± 21.01)% to 2005 (30.38 ± 20.23)% (P = 0.000 2), then declined slowly from 2005 to 2013 (28.99 ± 20.59)% and plateaued until 2018 (25.52 ± 15.51)%. Pulmonary interstitial damage and functional decline caused by SARS mostly recovered, with a greater extent of recovery within 2 years after rehabilitation. Femoral head necrosis induced by large doses of steroid pulse therapy in SARS patients was not progressive and was partially reversible.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""Long-term Sequelae of SARS: Recovery of Pulmonary and Bone Damage""",0.508521318435669,0.2285714285714286,0.06060606060606061,0.17142857142857143,0.01099563376942371,0.09478672985781991,0.9073248505592346
RNA structure interactions and ribonucleoprotein processes of the influenza A virus,"In one more years, we will ‘celebrate’ an exact centenary of the Spanish flu pandemic. With the rapid evolution of the influenza virus, the possibility of novel pandemic remains ever a concern. This review covers our current knowledge of the influenza A virus: on the role of RNA in translation, replication, what is known of the expressed proteins and the protein products generated from alternative splicing, and on the role of base pairing in RNA structure. We highlight the main events associated with viral entry into the cell, the transcription and replication process, an export of the viral genetic material from the nucleus and the final release of the virus. We discuss the observed potential roles of RNA secondary structure (the RNA base-pairing arrangement) and RNA/RNA interactions in this scheme.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""Understanding the Influenza A Virus: A Review of RNA Structure and Viral Replication""",0.524529218673706,0.6666666666666667,0.3636363636363636,0.33333333333333337,0.195647514979229,0.548913043478261,0.933762788772583

Perspectives of social entrepreneurship in Romania in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,"The usual and rather linear functioning of a country's economic and social structures is mandatory for setting stable grounds towards wellbeing. However, disruptions may appear in the ordinary flow of a community and produce a new order of action, prompting social ecosystems to focus on core operations. The COVID-19 pandemic, that has profoundly affected humanity in 2020 on multiple channels, has imposed a novel strategic thinking both for individuals and businesses, demanding an enhanced societal approach more than ever. Faced with such a major crisis, known in literature as a ""black swan"" event, social enterprises must show developed capabilities, flexibility and proactivity. Given the inaccurate evidence of social enterprises activating in Romania and of the limited studies focusing on their risk-response behavior, the paper explores the impact triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic over social entrepreneurship and in particular on Romanian social enterprises. To investigate the ability of these entities to successfully cope with this groundbreaking challenge, the paper firstly performs a literature review analysis on the reorganization of the social and economic sphere, in light of the pandemic. Furthermore, it approaches the challenges posed by the pandemic on traditional and social entrepreneurship, together with their reshaping of organizational resilience. Building on literature review and on document analysis of reports regarding essential actions to be embraced to maintain stability during the COVID-19 crisis, issued by renowned consultancy companies and organizations supporting social enterprises, the paper formulates an instrument for mapping the ability of Romanian social enterprises to overcome the pandemic threats.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""Assessing Romanian Social Enterprises' Resilience during the COVID-19 Pandemic""",0.5103073120117188,0.41666666666666663,0.27272727272727276,0.41666666666666663,0.08334454495388126,0.29069767441860467,0.9600014686584473

‘Feeling Fat’ Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic: Examining the Role of Emotion Dysregulation in the Body Displacement Hypothesis (preprint)/ en,"‘Feeling fat,’ the somatic experience of being overweight not entirely explained by objective weight, may occur due to the projection of negative affect onto the body. Individuals may manage ‘feeling fat’ via eating pathology (e.g., binge eating or dietary restriction) rather than address the source of negative affect. Thus, ‘feeling fat’ may occur in the absence of adaptive emotion regulation strategies. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased negative affect widely and may potentially contribute to the experience of ‘feeling fat’ and eating pathology among individuals with emotion dysregulation. This study examined whether emotion dysregulation moderates ‘feeling fat’s role as a mechanism underlying the relationship between COVID-19-related distress and eating pathology. This uniqueness of this model to eating pathology was investigated by comparing effects for binge eating and dietary restriction versus anxiety, depression, and problematic alcohol use. Structural equation modelling was used to analyze questionnaire data from 877 participants (77.3% women). ‘Feeling fat’ explained significant variance in the relationship between COVID-19-related distress and both binge eating and restriction. Emotion dysregulation moderated the strength of these relationships. However, ‘feeling fat’s role in the relationship between pandemic-related distress and negative psychological outcomes was not unique to eating pathology and did not vary based upon emotion dysregulation. Individuals with elevated emotion dysregulation are more likely to report eating pathology, but not other outcomes, when experiencing increased ‘feeling fat’. In contrast, ‘feeling fat’ underlies the relationship between COVID-19-related distress and transdiagnostic psychological outcomes, meaning ‘feeling fat’ should be considered a risk for psychopathology beyond eating disorders.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"Here's a possible title based on the abstract:

MO521 OUTCOME OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE PATIENTS WITH SARS COV-2 INFECTION- A SINGLE CENTRE EXPERIENCE,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Since the outbreak of COVID 19 there have been 88.1 million confirmed cases and 1,9 million deaths in 218 countries, while in Serbia we have had 39.867 cases of COVID 19 and 3479 deaths with approximate death rate of 1%. Fatality rate worldwide vary widely, from 0% in Singapore to 8,8% in Mexico with the average value of 3%. Although there are many published studies about COVID 19, influence of chronic kidney disease and chronic dialysis on outcome of patients with the coronavirus infection is still not clear. The aim of this study was to explore whether the presence of CKD including ESRD and chronic dialysis treatment increases COVID 19 patients’ risk for adverse clinical outcome. METHOD: This retrospective study included 88 patients who were hospitalized at the Nephrology department in Zvezdara University Clinical Center which was transformed into a COVID hospital at the time. These patients were treated from 01.04.2020. to 01.06.2020. and 37 (42%) of them had CKD, while 51 (58%) had no signs of kidney disease. We analysed data collection from the patients’ history, including age, sex, comorbidities, symptoms, blood and radiology findings, therapy and outcome. We compared outcome (fatal and need for mechanical ventilation) between CKD and non CKD group and also analized dialysis as a risk factor for adverse outcome. Statistical analysis has been performed using SPSS software version 20 and OR was calculated using Logistic Regression. RESULTS: We analysed 88 patients, a mean age of 62+15 years, 59.1% males. Out of 88 patients, 37 had CKD, while 27 of them were on hemodialysis and 2 on peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). At the end of follow-up, 46 patients (52.3%) was discharged home, 27 (30.7%) was transferred to another hospital and 14 (15.9%) died. Regarding influence of CKD on COVID-19 patients’ outcome it was shown that patients with CKD had 3-fold higher chances for discharge than for the fatal outcome (p=0.05) and 4-fold less risk for use of the mechanical ventilation (ns) as compared to non CKD patients. We also found that ESRD and chronic dialysis affect outcome with statistical significance (p=0.01) in a way that it doubles the risk for the adverse outcome. CONCLUSION: Patients with CKD, especially those with ESRD had significantly higher risk for the lethal outcome and higher chances to require the mechanical ventilation.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"Here's a possible title based on the abstract:

The role of STEMI integrated networking system based on tele-cardiology for reducing ischemic time and crossing wire time delayed during COVID 19 pandemic,"Background : During a public health emergency, such as outbreak of COVID-19, delayed for reperfusion become even more challenging to predict. Telecardiology has the advantage of reducing STEMI patient's access time to the emergency units and reduces the delayed for reperfusion. Purpose: Evaluate the impact of this program on pre-hospital and in-hospital (door-to-balloon) delays in STEMI patients admitted to a Tertiary Healthcare Center in Indonesia who performed Primary PCI between Pre Covid-19 and Covid-19 Era Method : This is a retrospective, observational study that included all patients, 18 to 90 years of age, who presented with STEMI via ACS prehospital network or through the Accident and Emergency department of a General Hospital. They were classified in four groups according to the method of admission: conventional emergency department group pre COVID-19 era (Group A), ACS prehospital network-group pre COVID- 19 era (Group B), Conventional emergency department group in the COVID-19 era (Group C), and ACS prehospital network-group in COVID-19 era (Group D). We selected a time frame of 1 month after declaration of COVID-19 infection as a “Pandemic” (ie, March 1 until December 31th 2020;COVID-19 era group).A group of STEMI patients from a similar time period of last year (ie, March 1 until December 31th 2019;pre-COVID-19 era group) was used as control. Outcomes of interest were number of patients referred for reperfusion, distribution of total ischemic time of patients referred in the network and door to crossing wire time. Results : A total of 184 patients were included in this study (123 Pre-COVID-19 and 61 during the COVID-19 Pandemic) according to the method of admission: Group A, 27 patients, Group B, 96 patients, Group C 25 patients, and Group D 36 patients. We found significant 42% drop in the number of STEMI patients treated by PPCI in this general hospital during pandemic era. Group B had the lowest mean of total ischemic time compare than group A, D, and C (217.34 ± 116 minute, 285 ± 165 minute, 432 ± 204 minute, 609 ± 246 minute, Respectively, P = 0.000. Group B had the lowest mean of crossing wire time compare than group A, D, and C (82 ± 10.9 minute, 96.4 ± 48 minute, 175 ± 41 minute, 132 ± 38 minute, Respectively, P = 0.000. The proportion of ischemic time delay > 720 minutes was more higher in Group C than Group D (36% vs 13.9%, P = 0.045, respectively). The proportion of crossing wire time > 140 minutes was more higher in Group C than group D (76% vs 27.8%, respectively, P = 0.000). The proportion of inhospital mortality was more higher in group C compare than group D ( 32% vs 11.1%, respectively, P = 0.045). Conclusion : Our STEMI networking based on tele-cardiology system reduce the ischemic time delayed, Crossing wire time delayed and Inhospital mortality during pandemic COVID-19 era.

A review on the COVID-19-related psychological impact on older adults: vulnerable or not?,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a novel event of the twenty-first century. Therefore, contemporary research is required to determine the current pandemic’s psychological impact on older populations. Soon after the COVID-19 outbreak, several narrative reviews and guidelines were released to support older adult’s psychological wellbeing. However, a lack of data from original studies was reported until May 2020. AIM: To identify studies published from May 2020 until January 2021 that quantitatively assessed the mental health impact of COVID-19 on older adults using validated psychometric tools. METHOD: A comprehensive literature search of original research articles was conducted using specific terms. The screening procedure was conducted stepwise. RESULTS: Among the 18 included studies, cross-sectional online surveys indicated that older adults were less psychologically distressed than younger ones. A longitudinal study revealed that COVID-19 did not have a major impact on loneliness and satisfaction with life. On the contrary, studies comparing pre- with peri-pandemic data revealed that older adults experienced more severe depressive/anxiety/stress symptoms and loneliness during the pandemic. Several studies reported though only subclinical symptoms, as well as low loneliness levels during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Research studies suggested that older age may buffer against the COVID-19-related impact on mental health. Despite evidence against generalised perceptions of vulnerability, older adults’ ability to adapt to adversity may be uneven, depending on cultural, social, economic and other individual factors. Taken together, the impact, moreover the long-term impact of COVID-19, is expected to vary across countries and older subpopulations, and remains to be evaluated by prospective, longitudinal studies.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"Here's a possible title based on the abstract:

A survey of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in COVID-19 patients,"Background and Aims: The novel coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has placed severe resource constraints on hospitals. High mortality rates of the COVID-19 have overwhelmed the resuscitation services. The constant fear of virus infection during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has placed severe restrictions on the resuscitation services. Reports of poor outcomes after CPR further dampened the spirits of CPR providers. Hence we surveyed CPR practices for COVID-19 patients across hospitals in India by health care providers. Material and Methods: An online survey using Google Forms was initiated to collect data on performance of CPR in diagnosed cases of COVID-19 after in-hospital cardiac arrest. The survey's web-link was publicized using social media, and participation sought of all personnel involved in CPR delivery in COVID-19 patients. The responses received were analyzed. The main outcome measured were determination of the percentage of COVID-19 patients discharged home who were administered CPR. Results: There were 248 responses from different parts of India. At the time of cardiac arrest, 194 victims had diffuse lung infiltrates, 22 had mild lung disease, while 32 had no documented lung lesion. Twenty-five victims had evidence of pulmonary embolism, 39 had cardiac involvement, and 3 had brain involvement. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved in 59.27% of cases but ROSC sustained in only 22.59%. 7.25% of patients, who received CPR, could be discharged home. Conclusion: The survey has shown reasonable survival rates after CPR administration in COVID-19 patients suffering from IHCA. We should not ignore the need to maximize live outcomes after CPR, even in COVID-19 patients. © 2021 Journal of Anaesthesiology Clinical Pharmacology Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"Title: ""Survival Rates of COVID-19 Patients Undergoing Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation in Indian Hospitals""",0.561875581741333,0.6363636363636364,0.4,0.3636363636363637,0.08609583710384033,0.646551724137931,0.9565531611442566
Acute Hemorrhagic Encephalitis Related to COVID-19.,"Purpose of Review The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the most critical public health challenge in recent history. In this report, we present a case of suspected acute hemorrhagic encephalitis with bilateral intracranial hemorrhages associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Recent Findings A 48-year-old female COVID-19-positive patient developed acute changes in her neurologic status. A head CT with CT angiography demonstrated extensive bilateral parietal and occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension and acute hydrocephalus. The patient was treated with an external ventricular drain, and a CSF sample was tested for SARS-CoV-2 but was found to be negative. Summary The underlying mechanism for developing acute hemorrhagic encephalitis in viral illnesses may be autoimmune in nature and warrants further investigation. The initial neurologic presentation of COVID-19-related hemorrhagic encephalitis is altered level of consciousness, which may prompt further neurologic examination and imaging to exclude this feature.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""COVID-19-Associated Acute Hemorrhagic Encephalitis: A Rare Complication""",0.518951416015625,0.6250000000000001,0.42857142857142855,0.375,0.10445522730720382,0.4033485540334855,0.9640671014785767
Consensus Report on Destination Therapy in Japanã- From the DT Committee of the Council for Clinical Use of Ventricular Assist Device Related Academic Societies,"Destination therapy (DT) is the indication to implant a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in a patient with stage D heart failure who is not a candidate for heart transplantation. The implantable LVAD has been utilized in Japan since 2011 under the indication of bridge to transplant (BTT). After almost 10 year lag, DT has finally been approved and reimbursed in May 2021 in Japan. To initiate the DT program in Japan, revision of the LVAD indication from BTT is necessary. Also, in-depth discussion of caregiver issues as well as end-of-life care is indispensable. For that purpose, we assembled a DT committee of multidisciplinary members in August 2020, and started monthly discussions via web-based communication during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a summary of the consensus reached after 6 months' discussion, and we have included as many relevant topics as possible. Clinical application of DT has just started, and we are willing to revise this consensus to meet the forthcoming issues raised during real-world clinical experience.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""Establishing Destination Therapy for Left Ventricular Assist Devices in Japan: A Multidisciplinary Consensus""",0.5263187885284424,0.48648648648648646,0.22857142857142854,0.32432432432432434,0.02566339512205003,0.30273437499999994,0.9523907899856567

Transplant Administration- A Survey of the Roles and Responsibilities of Kidney and Pancreas Medical Directors of U.S Transplant Centers.,"The current American Society of Transplantation (AST) accredited transplant fellowship programs in the U.S. provide no structured formal training in leadership and administration which is essential for successfully running a transplant program. We conducted a survey of medical directors of active adult kidney and kidney-pancreas transplant programs in U.S. about their demographics, training pathways, and roles and responsibilities. The survey was emailed to 183 medical directors, and 123 (67.2%) completed the survey. A majority of respondents were older than 50 years (61%), males (80%) and holding that position for more than 10 years (47%). Only 51% of current medical directors had taken that position after completing a one-year transplant fellowship and 58% took on the role with no prior administrative or leadership experience. The medical directors reported spending a median 50-75% of time in clinical responsibilities, 25-50% of time in administration and 0-25% time in research. The survey also captured various administrative roles of medical directors vis-à-vis other transplant leaders. The study, Clinical Transplantation for Review Only designed to be the starting point of an improvement initiative of the AST, provided important insight into the demographics, training pathways, roles and responsibilities, job satisfaction, education needs, and training gaps of current medical directors.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""Leadership and Administrative Training Gaps in Transplant Fellowship Programs""",4.924747943878174,0.20689655172413793,0.0,0.13793103448275865,0.009891094580518088,0.052356020942408384,0.9081947207450867
Acquisition of multidrug-resistant Enterobacterales during international travel: a systematic review of clinical and microbiological characteristics and meta-analyses of risk factors,"BACKGROUND: International tourism increased from 25 million tourist arrivals in 1950 to over 1.3 billion in 2017. These travelers can be exposed to (multi) resistant microorganisms, may become colonized, and bring them back home. This systematic review aims to identify the carriage rates of multidrug-resistant Enterobacterales (MDR-E) among returning travelers, to identify microbiological methods used, and to identify the leading risk factors for acquiring MDR-E during international travel. METHODS: Articles related to our research question were identified through a literature search in multiple databases (until June 18, 2019) - Embase, Medline Ovid, Cochrane, Scopus, Cinahl, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. RESULTS: Out of 3211 potentially relevant articles, we included 22 studies in the systematic review, and 12 studies in 7 random-effects meta-analyses. Highest carriage rates of MDR-E were observed after travel to Southern Asia (median 71%), followed by travel to Northern Africa (median 42%). Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) were identified in 5 out of 22 studies, from a few patients. However, in only eight out of 22 studies (36.4%) the initial laboratory method targeted detection of the presence of CPE in the original samples. The risk factor with the highest pooled odds ratio (OR) for MDR-E was travel to Southern Asia (pooled OR = 14.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.50 to 36.45), followed by antibiotic use during travel (pooled OR = 2.78, 95% CI = 1.76 to 4.39). CONCLUSIONS: Risk of acquiring MDR-E while travelling increases depending on travel destination and if antibiotics are used during travel. This information is useful for the development of guidelines for healthcare facilities with low MDR-E prevalence rates to prevent admission of carriers without appropriate measures. The impact of such guidelines should be assessed.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"Here's a possible title based on the abstract:

The impact of COVID-19 on subthreshold depressive symptoms: a longitudinal study,"AIMS: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represents an unprecedented threat to mental health. Herein, we assessed the impact of COVID-19 on subthreshold depressive symptoms and identified potential mitigating factors. METHODS: Participants were from Depression Cohort in China (ChiCTR registry number 1900022145). Adults (n = 1722) with subthreshold depressive symptoms were enrolled between March and October 2019 in a 6-month, community-based interventional study that aimed to prevent clinical depression using psychoeducation. A total of 1506 participants completed the study in Shenzhen, China: 726 participants, who completed the study between March 2019 and January 2020 (i.e. before COVID-19), comprised the 'wave 1' group; 780 participants, who were enrolled before COVID-19 and completed the 6-month endpoint assessment during COVID-19, comprised 'wave 2'. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia were assessed at baseline and endpoint (i.e. 6-month follow-up) using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), respectively. Measures of resilience and regular exercise were assessed at baseline. We compared the mental health outcomes between wave 1 and wave 2 groups. We additionally investigated how mental health outcomes changed across disparate stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, i.e. peak (7-13 February), post-peak (14-27 February), remission plateau (28 February-present). RESULTS: COVID-19 increased the risk for three mental outcomes: (1) depression (odds ratio [OR] = 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-1.62); (2) anxiety (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.16-1.88) and (3) insomnia (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.07-1.77). The highest proportion of probable depression and anxiety was observed post-peak, with 52.9% and 41.4%, respectively. Greater baseline resilience scores had a protective effect on the three main outcomes (depression: OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.19-0.37; anxiety: OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.14-0.33 and insomnia: OR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.11-0.28). Furthermore, regular physical activity mitigated the risk for depression (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.79-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic exerted a highly significant and negative impact on symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia. Mental health outcomes fluctuated as a function of the duration of the pandemic and were alleviated to some extent with the observed decline in community-based transmission. Augmenting resiliency and regular exercise provide an opportunity to mitigate the risk for mental health symptoms during this severe public health crisis.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"Here's a possible title based on the abstract:

CalScope: Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence from Vaccination and Prior Infection in Adults and Children in California May 2021– July 2021,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from vaccination and/or prior infection is critical to the public health response to the pandemic. CalScope is a population-based serosurvey in 7 counties in California. METHODS: We invited 200,000 randomly sampled households to enroll up to 1 adult and 1 child between April 20, 2021 and June 16, 2021. We tested all specimen for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike proteins, and each participant completed an online survey.

The future of internationalization of higher education in challenging global contexts,"Internationalization has been over the past three decades one of the key focus points of (inter)national and institutional policies for higher education, with two related components: internationalization abroad, and internationalization at home. The 'abroad' component: mobility of students, faculty and programs, has been more predominant than the 'at home' component: internationalization of the curriculum and learning outcomes, perceived as a neoliberal and western paradigm. What will be the future of internationalization? Do we see a return from competition to cooperation? What will be the impact of the changing global economic, ecological and political context? These questions will be addressed in a critical analytical way in this paper, taking into account the impact of Covid-19 on the internationalization of higher education.Alternate abstract: A internacionalização tem sido, nas últimas três décadas, um dos principais focos das políticas (inter) nacionais e institucionais para o ensino superior, com dois componentes relacionados: internacionalização no exterior e internacionalização no país.

"Successful patient education on COVID-19 vaccine safety in a large rheumatology cohort using interactive mobile-phone video technology: context, results, and next steps","Background: There are reported concerns of patient misunderstanding of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination safety. It is particularly important that these are understood in patients taking complex immunusuppressive therapies. Rapid delivery of targeted and up-to-date video messages from clinicians sent directly to patients could address patient uncertainty, and improve COVID-19 vaccination uptake. Innovative SMS (short message service) based video message has already shown promise in delivering COVID-19 information to patients [1]. We present our experience in creating a tailored vaccine information video sent directly to our large cohort of patients in the UK with a range of rheumatic diseases and report on the learning points going forward. Objectives: Our three objectives were: (1) educate our patients using an interactive mobile video information resource outlining the safety of the COVID vaccination in these patient groups;(2) better understand our patients' views of the COVID-19 vaccine;(3) evaluate the patient experience of this approach. Methods: We designed and recorded an 8-minute interactive web-based video delivered education resource designed for mobile phones. This included: aims of the video;details of licenced vaccines;UK vaccination schedule;frequently asked questions;links to national charity resources;our clinician recommendations;a rheumatologist being vaccinated;case studies;and summary data. We produced a simple mobile phone web-based evaluation of the resource, including anonymised patient demographics, their understanding of the safety of the vaccine pre/ post video, and their user experience. Resource and evaluation were piloted by local healthcare professionals, our Patient Participation Group, a national charity, and approved by senior management. We distributed this to our follow-up patient cohort via our hospital SMS provider on 21.12.20, at the start of roll-out of UK vaccines, containing a link to the resource and evaluation. Results: Of a cohort of 10,981 patients, we had 8886 mobile phone numbers. At Day 14, we recorded 2358 video views (26.3%) and 664/2358 completed evaluations (28.1%). Only one person reported being unable to watch the video. Before watching the video, 348/664 patients (52.4%) were unsure if the vaccine was safe and/or recommended for them, rising to 626/664 (94.3%) post-video. Reasons for uncertainty after the video (38/664) included drug allergy and fertility concerns. Following the video, 509/664 patients (76.6%) reported that they were more likely to have the vaccination. The majority of the patients (614/660, 93.0%) agreed that the method was a helpful method to share such information.Age distribution of our whole cohort, patients with mobile phones, and responders were similar: Age >50 was 80.4%,76.3%,and 88.6% respectively. A large proportion was treated with immunosuppressive medication (61.3% conventional DMARD, 39.4% biological DMARD and 17.6% corticosteroids). Gender and case mix for responders were similar to published data from our cohort: female 74.0%;rheumatoid arthritis commonest disease (389/664, 58.5%). Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show the potential for SMS linked interactive multimedia message for patient education. The multimedia component allows users to easily navigate to relevant sections, and access a choice of linked resources. We demonstrate this low-cost technology is simple, effective and well placed to assist physicians in educating patients during a time when face-to-face contact is proving to be difficult. We have shown high levels of patient satisfaction, reassurance, and self-reported behaviour change. Such technology has potential utility for national bodies, primary and secondary care groups, and merits further research.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"Here's a possible title based on the abstract:

Long-term Changes of Disinfection Byproducts in Treatment of Simulated Ballast Water,"This study investigated the changes in concentrations of haloacetic acids (HAAs) and haloacetonitriles (HANs) as disinfection byproducts (DBPs) for different storage times (as long as 20 days) and temperatures (5 to 20°C). A ship’s voyage after treatment of its ballast water with active substances was considered. The HAA showed a clear trend of increasing concentration only with storage time, especially for dibromoacetic acid (DBAA). Dissolved organic nitrogen concentration was increased by the decomposition of dead organisms at 10 days, and then reacted with the remaining total residual oxidants, resulting in increased concentration of DBPs. An environmental risk assessment indicated that DBAN and monochloroacetic acid (MCAA) could have a negative impact on the marine environment. This study suggests that, because all international vessels must have a ballast water management system installed by September, 2024, the conc e ntra tio ns of DBPs, especially DBAN, MCAA, and DBAA, should be monitored in the waters at major international ports.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""Disinfection Byproduct Concentrations in Ballast Water: Effects of Storage Time and Temperature""",0.5336704254150391,0.5,0.18181818181818182,0.4166666666666667,0.03514847831369806,0.44834307992202727,0.9541019797325134
Bacteria–autophagy interplay: a battle for survival,"Autophagy is a cellular process that targets proteins, lipids and organelles to lysosomes for degradation, but it has also been shown to combat infection with various pathogenic bacteria. In turn, bacteria have developed diverse strategies to avoid autophagy by interfering with autophagy signalling or the autophagy machinery and, in some cases, they even exploit autophagy for their growth.

"How has COVID-19 social distancing impacted physical activity patterns? Data from the PAMPA cohort, Brazil","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate how social distancing measures affected physical activity (PA) patterns in adults from Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. METHODS: Participants were recruited from social and local media campaigns, contacts with private and public universities, as well as research personal contacts across the state. PA was assessed before (retrospectively) and during social distancing. Frequency (days per week) and time (minutes per day) were asked to those participants who practiced PA. Two PA variables were built to each time-frame (before and during social distancing): 1) any PA (yes/no question), and 2) sufficient PA (based on the 150 min/week cut-off point). RESULTS: Overall, 2321 participants answered the questionnaire. Any and sufficient PA decreased from before to during social distancing (22.3% and 17.0%, respectively). A linear increase of activity during social distancing was observed in participants who practiced up to 400 min or less of PA per week before social distancing. Regarding associated factors, female, overweight/obese and diagnosed chronic disease participants were less likely to practice any or sufficient PA during social distancing when compared to the period before. CONCLUSION: PA practice (both any and sufficient) decreased in Southern Brazil in the first months of social distancing. Women, overweight/obese and chronic diseased participants showed a higher decrease in PA compared to other groups. Finally, those participants who practiced PA before social distancing were more likely to continue practicing during COVID-19 pandemic.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"Here's a possible title based on the abstract:

Epidemiological analysis of asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019-infected individuals in the community based on an individual-based model,"Background: Asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-infected individuals (AIIs) is a special group that differs from COVID-19 patients. This will provide us with a deeper understanding on the impact of AIIs on the epidemic and a theoretical basis to establish more precise prevention and control measures to control this disease. Methods: : We established an individual-based computer model to simulate the occurrence, infection, discovery, quarantine, and quarantine release (recovery) of AIIs or patients within the community. The model was used to explore the effects of measures such as active tracing, laboratory testing, active treatment, and home quarantine on the epidemic. Results: : Given the condition that R 0 =1.2, when a case of imported AII was reported in the community, the implementation of measures reduced the number of AIIs and patients by 62.2% and 62.4%, respectively. The number of undetected AIIs and patients peaked at 302 d of the epidemic, reaching 53 and 20 individuals, respectively. Conclusion: The implementation of sustained active tracing, laboratory testing, active treatment, and home quarantine can significantly reduce probability of disease outbreak and block the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic caused by asymptomatic infected individuals in the community.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"Here's a possible title based on the abstract:

Characteristics and factors associated with mortality of 200 COVID-19 patients at a Philippine COVID-19 tertiary referral center,"Objectives. To describe the clinical profile and factors associated with mortality among the first 200 patients confirmed to have COVID-19 infection admitted in the University of the Philippines – Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH). Methodology. We conducted a review of adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to the UP-PGH, a designated COVID-19 referral center. Demographic, clinical data and clinical outcomes were extracted from medical records. Frequencies and distributions of various clinical characteristics were described, and factors associated with mortality were investigated. Results. Of the 200 patients in our cohort, most were male (55.5%), and the median age was 56 years old. Underlying comorbid illnesses were present in 67.5% of patients, which included hypertension (49.5%), diabetes mellitus (26.5%), and other cardiovascular diseases (20.5%). The most frequent presenting symptoms were cough (69.0%), fever (58.5%), or shortness of breath (53.0%). Most patients presented with mild (n=41, 20.5%) to moderate illness (n=99, 49.5%) and only 60 were considered severely (n=32, 16.0%) or critically ill (n=28, 14.0%). Many (61%) received empiric antibiotics, while 44.5% received either repurposed drugs or investigational therapies for COVID-19. Bacterial co-infection was documented in 11%, with Klebsiella pneumoniae commonly isolated. In-hospital mortality was 17.5%, which was highest for critical COVID-19 (71.4%). Mortality was observed to be higher among patients aged 60 and above, requiring oxygen, ventilatory support, and ICU admission, and those who developed acute kidney injury, acute stroke, sepsis, and nosocomial pneumonia. Conclusion. Our study confirmed that COVID-19 affects older individuals and those with underlying comorbid conditions. Empiric antimicrobial treatment was given for most patients, despite documentation of bacterial infection in only 11%. K. pneumoniae was commonly isolated, reflecting local epidemiology. The mortality rate during this early period of the pandemic was high and comparable with other institutions. Factors associated with mortality were related to critical COVID-19 and were similar to other studies. © 2021 University of the Philippines Manila.

TLR3 controls constitutive IFN-β antiviral immunity in human fibroblasts and cortical neurons.,"Human herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis can be caused by inborn errors of the TLR3 pathway, resulting in impairment of CNS cell-intrinsic antiviral immunity. Deficiencies of the TLR3 pathway impair cell-intrinsic immunity to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and HSV-1 in fibroblasts, and to HSV-1 in cortical but not trigeminal neurons. The underlying molecular mechanism is thought to involve impaired IFN-α/β induction by the TLR3 recognition of dsRNA viral intermediates or by-products. However, we show here that human TLR3 controls constitutive levels of IFNB mRNA and secreted bioactive IFN-β protein, and thereby also controls constitutive mRNA levels for IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in fibroblasts. Tlr3-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts also have lower basal ISG levels. Moreover, human TLR3 controls basal levels of IFN-β secretion and ISG mRNA in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons. Consistently, TLR3-deficient human fibroblasts and cortical neurons are vulnerable not only to both VSV and HSV-1, but also to several other families of viruses. The mechanism by which TLR3 restricts viral growth in human fibroblasts and cortical neurons in vitro and, by inference, by which the human CNS prevents infection by HSV-1 in vivo, is therefore based on the control of early viral infection by basal IFN-β immunity.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"Title: ""TLR3-mediated Basal IFN-β Immunity Restricts Viral Infection in Human Cells""",2.864698886871338,0.4166666666666667,0.09090909090909091,0.4166666666666667,0.03592143420342892,0.24093511450381686,0.9535976648330688

Association of HLA Class I Genotypes With Severity of Coronavirus Disease-19,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules play a crucial role in the development of a specific immune response to viral infections by presenting viral peptides at the cell surface where they will be further recognized by T cells. In the present manuscript, we explored whether HLA class I genotypes can be associated with the critical course of Coronavirus Disease-19 by searching possible connections between genotypes of deceased patients and their age at death. HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C genotypes of n = 111 deceased patients with COVID-19 (Moscow, Russia) and n = 428 volunteers were identified with next-generation sequencing. Deceased patients were split into two groups according to age at the time of death: n = 26 adult patients aged below 60 and n = 85 elderly patients over 60. With the use of HLA class I genotypes, we developed a risk score (RS) which was associated with the ability to present severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) peptides by the HLA class I molecule set of an individual. The resulting RS was significantly higher in the group of deceased adults compared to elderly adults [p = 0.00348, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC = 0.68)]. In particular, presence of HLA-A*01:01 allele was associated with high risk, while HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*03:01 mainly contributed to low risk. The analysis of patients with homozygosity strongly highlighted these results: homozygosity by HLA-A*01:01 accompanied early deaths, while only one HLA-A*02:01 homozygote died before 60 years of age. Application of the constructed RS model to an independent Spanish patients cohort (n = 45) revealed that the score was also associated with the severity of the disease. The obtained results suggest the important role of HLA class I peptide presentation in the development of a specific immune response to COVID-19.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""Association of HLA Class I Genotypes with COVID-19 Severity and Mortality""",4.796499729156494,0.75,0.5454545454545454,0.6666666666666666,0.48633831680799433,0.6696428571428572,0.9736016988754272
Teaching soldiers French: How motivation affects their success,"The paper deals with problematic of teaching adults a second foreign language. The article has focused on the groups of young soldiers who attended French courses for a period of two to four weeks during the fall semester of 2020 in the COVID pandemic situation. The main objective of the paper is to help teachers better plan teaching for specific groups of students. In this paper, the motivation of course participants have been examined. The paper suggests that the intrinsic motivation of the students allows participants to learn the language better. It has been observed that neither previous education in French nor career development is significant for student success. The findings suggest that students who were intrinsically motivated before the start of the course (for personal or professional reasons) tended to work more in their free time;and therefore, they mastered French sooner. The findings helped the researchers gain a better understanding of student failure and helped them in the adaptation of offered courses. The paper could be useful for anyone teaching adults a second language. Copyright © 2021.

"Political regime, data transparency, and COVID-19 death cases","The COVID-19—the worst pandemic since the Spanish flu—has dramatically changed the world, with a significant number of people suffering from and dying of the disease. Some scholars argue that democratic governments are disadvantaged in coping with the current pandemic mainly because they cannot intervene in their citizens' lives as aggressively as their authoritarian counterparts. Other scholars, however, suggest that possible data manipulation may account for the apparent advantage of authoritarian countries. Taking such a possibility seriously, this paper analyzes the relationship between political regimes, data transparency, and COVID-19 deaths using cross-national data for over 108 countries, obtained from Worldometer COVID-19 Data, Polity V Project, Variety of Democracy (V-Dem) Project, HRV Transparency Project among other sources. Regression analyses indicate that authoritarian countries do not necessarily tend to have fewer COVID-19 deaths than their democratic counterparts after controlling for other factors, especially data transparency. The transparency variable itself, on the other hand, is positively correlated with the number of death cases more consistently (P &lt;0.05). Overall, the estimation results point to the possible data manipulation, not the nature of regime characteristics itself, as a more significant source for the seemingly low casualty rates in authoritarian countries.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""Reevaluating Authoritarian Advantage: The Role of Data Transparency in COVID-19 Deaths""",4.791987657546997,0.4761904761904762,0.3157894736842105,0.4761904761904762,0.03342866121562732,0.3605769230769231,0.9435956478118896
Rice endosperm is cost‐effective for the production of recombinant griffithsin with potent activity against HIV,"Protein microbicides containing neutralizing antibodies and antiviral lectins may help to reduce the rate of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) if it is possible to manufacture the components in large quantities at a cost affordable in HIV‐endemic regions such as sub‐Saharan Africa. We expressed the antiviral lectin griffithsin (GRFT), which shows potent neutralizing activity against HIV, in the endosperm of transgenic rice plants (Oryza sativa), to determine whether rice can be used to produce inexpensive GRFT as a microbicide ingredient. The yield of (OS)GRFT in the best‐performing plants was 223 μg/g dry seed weight. We also established a one‐step purification protocol, achieving a recovery of 74% and a purity of 80%, which potentially could be developed into a larger‐scale process to facilitate inexpensive downstream processing. (OS)GRFT bound to HIV glycans with similar efficiency to GRFT produced in Escherichia coli. Whole‐cell assays using purified (OS)GRFT and infectivity assays using crude extracts of transgenic rice endosperm confirmed that both crude and pure (OS)GRFT showed potent activity against HIV and the crude extracts were not toxic towards human cell lines, suggesting they could be administered as a microbicide with only minimal processing. A freedom‐to‐operate analysis confirmed that GRFT produced in rice is suitable for commercial development, and an economic evaluation suggested that 1.8 kg/ha of pure GRFT could be produced from rice seeds. Our data therefore indicate that rice could be developed as an inexpensive production platform for GRFT as a microbicide component.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""Production of Antiviral Lectin Griffithsin in Transgenic Rice for HIV Microbicide Development""",3.8178439140319824,0.42857142857142855,0.07692307692307691,0.28571428571428575,0.037013098960369896,0.2861670395227443,0.9570058584213257
Evaluation of Bivalirudin as the Primary Anticoagulant in Patients Receiving Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for SARS-CoV-2-Associated Acute Respiratory Failure.,"BACKGROUND Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a potential option for the management of severe acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. Conflicting the use of this therapy is the known coagulopathy within COVID-19, leading to an incidence of venous thrombotic events of 25% to 49%. To date, limited guidance is available on optimal anticoagulation strategies in this population. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utilization of a pharmacist-driven bivalirudin dosing protocol for anticoagulation in the setting of ECMO for COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. METHODS This was a single-center retrospective chart review over a 9-month period of patients receiving bivalirudin while on ECMO. All patients with acute respiratory failure requiring ECMO with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction were included. Bivalirudin was dosed via aPTT monitoring after a starting dose of 0.2 or 0.3 mg/kg/h. RESULTS There were 33 patients included in this study, all receiving mechanical ventilation. The most common starting dose of bivalirudin was 0.2 mg/kg/h, with an average time to therapeutic range of 20 hours. Compared to previous reports, rates of bleeding were low at 15.1%, and 6.1% of patients developed a new venous thromboembolic event while on ECMO. ECMO survival was 51.5%, with an ICU mortality rate of 48.5%. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE In the first published report of its use within this population, bivalirudin was found to be a viable choice for anticoagulation in those patients on ECMO for severe respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"Here's a possible title based on the abstract:

The Focused Neurosurgical Examination During Telehealth Visits: Guidelines During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond,"OBJECTIVE: To provide guidelines to healthcare workers for performing a focused neurological examination via telemedicine during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-2019) pandemic. METHODS: We reviewed our department's outpatient clinic visits after the implementation of a telemedicine protocol in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Crossover rates from telehealth to in-person visits were evaluated and guidelines for performing a telemedicine neurological exam were created based on the consensus of 16 neurosurgical attending providers over a four-month period. RESULTS: From March 23, 2020 to July 20, 2020, some 2157 telehealth visits were performed in our department. Some 26 were converted to in-person visits by the provider request with the most cited reason for conversion being the need for a more detailed patient evaluation. Based on these experiences, we created a graphical tutorial to address the key components of the neurological exam with adaptations specific to the telehealth visit. CONCLUSIONS: In response to the global coronavirus pandemic, telemedicine has become an integral part of neurosurgeons' daily practice. Telemedicine failures remain low but primarily occur due to a need for more comprehensive evaluations.

Influence of COVID-19 Building Restrictions on Physical Activity Promotion Through Increased Stair Use and Limited Elevator Access: A Quasi-Experimental Study-Sport and Physical Activity Group Active Campus Project,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of UK government COVID-19 safe offices policy to increase stair use in a higher education setting during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Automated counts at 3 ground floor staircases and the elevator entrances were used to estimate stair to elevator use ratio for ascent and descent from/to the ground floor of a university building at baseline (January to March 2020), first and second intervention months (October 2020, November 2020, respectively). Stair promoting signage and a 1-way system was implemented, in line with government policy. RESULTS: At baseline, stair to elevator use ratio for ascent from and descent to the ground floor was 1.36 (0.02) and 1.88 (0.02) people, respectively. The ratio significantly increased in the first intervention month to 2.64 (0.09) and 3.96 (0.22) people for ascent and descent, respectively. However, the ratio decreased between the first and second intervention months to 1.63 (0.06) and 3.05 (0.52) people for ascent and descent, respectively.

Critical event debriefing: a checklist for the aftermath.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Millions of perioperative crises (e.g. anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest) may occur annually. Critical event debriefing can offer benefits to the individual, team, and system, yet only a fraction of perioperative critical events are debriefed in real-time. This publication aims to review evidence-based best practices for proximal critical event debriefing. RECENT FINDINGS Evidence-based key processes to consider for proximal critical event debriefing can be summarized by the WATER mnemonic: Welfare check (assessing team members' emotional and physical wellbeing to continue providing care); Acute/short-term corrections (matters to be addressed before the next case); Team reactions and reflections (summarizing case; listening to team member reactions; plus/delta conversation); Education (lessons learned from the event and debriefing); Resource awareness and longer term needs [follow-up (e.g. safety/quality improvement report), local peer-support and employee assistance resources]. A cognitive aid to accompany this mnemonic is provided with the publication. SUMMARY There is growing literature on how to conduct proximal perioperative critical event debriefing. Evidence-based best practices, as well as a cognitive aid to apply them, may help bridge the gap between theory and clinical practice. In this era of increased attention to burnout and wellness, the consideration of interventions to improve the quality and frequency of critical event debriefing is paramount.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""Best Practices for Proximal Perioperative Critical Event Debriefing""",3.8939805030822754,0.5,0.2857142857142857,0.375,0.1122444464861146,0.37500000000000006,0.889747679233551
Emerging role of exosomes in the pathology of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases; destructive and therapeutic properties,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is known as the third leading cause of human death globally. Enhanced chronic inflammation and pathological remodeling are the main consequences of COPD, leading to decreased life span. Histological and molecular investigations revealed that prominent immune cell infiltration and release of several cytokines contribute to progressive chronic remodeling. Recent investigations have revealed that exosomes belonging to extracellular vesicles are involved in the pathogenesis of COPD. It has been elucidated that exosomes secreted from immune cells are eligible to carry numerous pro-inflammatory factors exacerbating the pathological conditions.

Tissue distribution of a feline AGP related protein (fAGPrP) in cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)(),"Feline α(1)-acid glycoprotein (fAGP) increases during feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). We have recently identified a 29 kDa protein that we named feline AGP-related protein (fAGPrP) due to its cross-reactivity with an anti-human AGP monoclonal antibody. In this work we describe the tissue distribution of fAGPrP during FIP, and its relationship with feline coronavirus (FCoV) and myeloid cells. Tissues from five control cats and from 15 cats with FIP were examined by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies against human AGP, FCoV and myeloid antigens. Diffuse fAGPrP positivity within the lesions, likely due to vascular plasma leakage, endothelial and epithelial lining were detectable. Compared to controls, fAGPrP-expressing cells often increased in number and were diffusely distributed in lymph nodes, as usually occurs for IgM-producing plasma cells during early immune responses. These findings did not depend on the presence of FCoVs or of myeloid cells, suggesting that fAGPrP is not directly involved in the pathogenesis of FIP.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""Tissue Distribution and Relationship of Feline AGP-Related Protein in Feline Infectious Peritonitis""",2.795931339263916,0.7586206896551724,0.4444444444444445,0.7586206896551724,0.05814486089670462,0.36163522012578625,0.9698333740234375
At the height of the storm: Healthcare staff’s health conditions and job satisfaction and their associated predictors during the epidemic peak of COVID-19,"Abstract This study reports the physical health, mental health, anxiety, depression, distress, and job satisfaction of healthcare staff in Iran when the country faced its highest number of total active COVID-19 cases. In a sample of 304 healthcare staff (doctors, nurses, radiologists, technicians, etc.), we found a sizable portion reached the cutoff levels of disorders in anxiety (28.0%), depression (30.6%), and distress (20.1%). Age, gender, education, access to PPE (personal protective equipment), healthcare institutions (public vs. private), and individual status of COVID-19 infection each predicted some but not all the outcome variables of SF-12, PHQ-4, K6, and job satisfaction. The healthcare workers varied greatly in their access to PPE and in their status of COVID-19 infection: negative (69.7%), unsure (28.0%), and positive (2.3%). The predictors were also different from those identified in previous studies of healthcare staff during the COVID-19 crisis in China.

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 induces fibrin(ogen) resistant to fibrinolysis: Implications for microclot formation in COVID-19,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) -induced infection, the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is characterized by unprecedented clinical pathologies. One of the most important pathologies, is hypercoagulation and microclots in the lungs of patients. Here we study the effect of isolated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit as potential inflammagen sui generis. Using scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy as well as mass spectrometry, we investigate the potential of this inflammagen to interact with platelets and fibrin(ogen) directly to cause blood hypercoagulation. Using platelet poor plasma (PPP), we show that spike protein may interfere with blood flow. Mass spectrometry also showed that when spike protein S1 is added to healthy PPP, it results in structural changes to {beta} and {gamma} fibrin(ogen), complement 3, and prothrombin. These proteins were substantially resistant to trypsinization, in the presence of spike protein S1. Here we suggest that, in part, the presence of spike protein in circulation may contribute to the hypercoagulation in COVID-19 positive patients and may cause substantial impairment of fibrinolysis. Such lytic impairment may result in the persistent large microclots we have noted here and previously in plasma samples of COVID-19 patients.

Improved targeting of radio-frequency ablation probes and thermal sensors: a preliminary investigation of flat-panel CT-guided ablation of renal tumors performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory.,"Flat-panel detector CT (FD-CT) provides cross-sectional CT-images while offering an improved workspace using fluoroscopic guidance for thermal probe placement such as for radiofrequency ablation (RFA) needles and thermal sensors. The purpose of this article is to test the feasibility of FD-CT in the application of renal tumor ablation in a ""hybrid operating room"" environment. Eleven patients with renal masses diagnosed preprocedurally with contrast-enhanced CT scan underwent core biopsy and simultaneous CT-RFA under general anesthesia with FD-CT guidance in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Scans were taken preablation for tumor targeting, intermittently for probe placement and guidance of temperature sensors, and postablation. Perioperative and postoperative outcomes, pathologic results, and radiographic follow-up were recorded for each patient. Target temperatures >60°C to guide treatment end point were reached for each tumor periphery. Biopsy pathology showed 6/11 (55%) to be renal-cell carcinoma, and 2/11 (18%) to be benign; 3/11 (27%) had an indeterminate biopsy result. Three Clavien grade I complications occurred. One patient showed evidence of recurrent disease on postoperative CT scan.

Characterization of the fusion core in zebrafish endogenous retroviral envelope protein,"Zebrafish endogenous retrovirus (ZFERV) is the unique endogenous retrovirus in zebrafish, as yet, containing intact open reading frames of its envelope protein gene in zebrafish genome. Similarly, several envelope proteins of endogenous retroviruses in human and other mammalian animal genomes (such as syncytin-1 and 2 in human, syncytin-A and B in mouse) were identified and shown to be functional in induction of cell–cell fusion involved in placental development. ZFERV envelope protein (Env) gene appears to be also functional in vivo because it is expressible. After sequence alignment, we found ZFERV Env shares similar structural profiles with syncytin and other type I viral envelopes, especially in the regions of N- and C-terminal heptad repeats (NHR and CHR) which were crucial for membrane fusion. We expressed the regions of N + C protein in the ZFERV Env (residues 459–567, including predicted NHR and CHR) to characterize the fusion core structure. We found N + C protein could form a stable coiled-coil trimer that consists of three helical NHR regions forming a central trimeric core, and three helical CHR regions packing into the grooves on the surface of the central core. The structural characterization of the fusion core revealed the possible mechanism of fusion mediated by ZFERV Env. These results gave comprehensive explanation of how the ancient virus infects the zebrafish and integrates into the genome million years ago, and showed a rational clue for discovery of physiological significance (e.g., medicate cell–cell fusion).",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""Structural Characterization of Zebrafish Endogenous Retrovirus (ZFERV) Envelope Protein and Its Role in Cell-Cell Fusion""",3.862342357635498,0.5925925925925926,0.24,0.4444444444444444,0.04007781700028194,0.5952065677966102,0.9610236287117004
Sensitivity and breadth of detection of high-throughput sequencing for adventitious virus detection,"High-throughput sequencing (HTS) is capable of broad virus detection encompassing both known and unknown adventitious viruses in a variety of sample matrices. We describe the development of a general-purpose HTS-based method for the detection of adventitious viruses. Performance was evaluated using 16 viruses equivalent to well-characterized National Institutes of Health (NIH) virus stocks and another six viruses of interest. A viral vaccine crude harvest and a cell substrate matrix were spiked with 22 viruses. Specificity was demonstrated for all 22 viruses at the species level. Our method was capable of detecting and identifying adventitious viruses spiked at 10(4) genome copies per milliliter in a viral vaccine crude harvest and 0.01 viral genome copies spiked per cell in a cell substrate matrix. Moreover, 9 of the 11 NIH model viruses with published in vivo data were detected by HTS with an equivalent or better sensitivity (in a viral vaccine crude harvest).

Antitussive noscapine and antiviral drug conjugates as arsenal against COVID-19: a comprehensive chemoinformatics analysis,"Coronavirus pandemic has caused a vast number of deaths worldwide. Thus creating an urgent need to develop effective counteragents against novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Many antiviral drugs have been repurposed for treatment but implicated minimal recovery, which further advanced the need for clearer insights and innovation to derive effective therapeutics. Strategically, Noscapine, an approved antitussive drug with positive effects on lung linings may show favorable outcomes synergistically with antiviral drugs in trials. Hence, we have theoretically examined the combinatorial drug therapy by culminating the existing experimental results with in silico analyses. We employed the antitussive noscapine in conjugation with antiviral drugs (Chloroquine, Umifenovir, Hydroxychloroquine, Favlplravir and Galidesivir). We found that Noscapine-Hydroxychloroquine (Nos-Hcq) conjugate has strong binding affinity for the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, which performs key biological function in virus infection and progression. Nos-Hcq was analyzed through molecular dynamics simulation. The MD simulation for 100 ns affirmed the stable binding of conjugation unprecedentedly through RMSD and radius of gyration plots along with critical reaction coordinate binding free energy profile. Also, dynamical residue cross-correlation map with principal component analysis depicted the stable binding of Nos-Hcq conjugate to Mpro domains with optimal secondary structure statistics of complex dynamics. Also, we reveal the drugs with stable binding to major domains of Mpro can significantly improve the work profile of reaction coordinates, drug accession and inhibitory regulation of Mpro. The designed combinatorial therapy paves way for further prioritized in vitro and in vivo investigations for drug with robust binding against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""Synergistic Combinatorial Therapy: Noscapine-Hydroxychloroquine Conjugate as a Potential Treatment for COVID-19""",4.821052312850952,0.42857142857142855,0.15384615384615383,0.3571428571428571,0.01880756769245147,0.24966442953020132,0.9422174096107483

"The Role of Moral Foundations, Anticipated Guilt and Personal Responsibility in Predicting Anti-consumption for Environmental Reasons","In response to the growing importance of environmental issues, more and more consumers are turning to anti-consumption by reducing, rejecting, or avoiding consumption. Covering the intersection of sustainable consumption and anti-consumption, previous studies relied on socio-cognitive models to explain this decision. In order to extend their findings, we consider the moral and emotional perspectives to examine reducing consumption for environmental reasons in a particular context, i.e. air travel. It is against this backdrop that we propose a conceptual model that includes moral foundations as the main antecedent, followed by anticipated guilt and personal responsibility, while intention to reduce consumption (i.e. air travel) for environmental reasons, positive word of mouth about reducing air travel (WOM) and environmental activism represent the outcomes. The proposed model is tested on a sample of 511 respondents from a UK online consumer panel. Our results confirm the importance of moral foundations, anticipated guilt and personal responsibility and their interplay in the prediction of intention to reduce consumption for environmental reasons. Anticipated guilt influences WOM, while personal responsibility influences activism. In addition, intentions to reduce consumption for environmental reasons have a positive impact on WOM and environmental activism.

The Hydra-Headed Coronaviruses: Implications of COVID-19 for Homeopathy.,"Successful homeopathic prescriptions are based on careful individualization of symptoms, either for an individual patient or collectively in the case of epidemic outbreaks. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic was initially represented as a severe acute respiratory illness, with eventual dramatic complications. However, over time it revealed to be a complex systemic disease with manifestations derived from viral-induced inflammation and hypercoagulability, thus liable to affect any body organ or system. As a result, clinical presentation is variable, in addition to variations associated with several individual and collective risk factors. Given the extreme variability of pathology and clinical manifestations, a single, or a few, universal homeopathic preventive Do not split medicine(s) do not seem feasible. Yet homeopathy may have a relevant role to play, inasmuch as the vast majority of patients only exhibit the mild form of disease and are indicated to self-care at home, without standard monitoring, follow-up, or treatment.

Optimal periodic closure for minimizing risk in emerging disease outbreaks,"Without vaccines and treatments, societies must rely on non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies to control the spread of emerging diseases such as COVID-19. Though complete lockdown is epidemiologically effective, because it eliminates infectious contacts, it comes with significant costs. Several recent studies have suggested that a plausible compromise strategy for minimizing epidemic risk is periodic closure, in which populations oscillate between wide-spread social restrictions and relaxation. However, no underlying theory has been proposed to predict and explain optimal closure periods as a function of epidemiological and social parameters. In this work we develop such an analytical theory for SEIR-like model diseases, showing how characteristic closure periods emerge that minimize the total outbreak, and increase predictably with the reproductive number and incubation periods of a disease- as long as both are within predictable limits. Using our approach we demonstrate a sweet-spot effect in which optimal periodic closure is maximally effective for diseases with similar incubation and recovery periods. Our results compare well to numerical simulations, including in COVID-19 models where infectivity and recovery show significant variation.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""Optimal Periodic Closure Strategy for Emerging Diseases: A Theoretical Framework""",2.831955671310425,0.6,0.3333333333333333,0.6,0.08737167851715875,0.5461165048543689,0.9284151792526245
Viral respiratory infections diagnosed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction in pediatric patients,"Syndromic diagnosis by multiplex nucleic acid amplification tests is the most practical approach to respiratory tract infections since the symptoms are rarely agent‐specific. The aim of this study was to investigate the respiratory viruses in children admitted to a university hospital with acute respiratory tract infection during the last 8 years by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. A total of 3162 respiratory samples collected from children between April 2011 and April 2018 tested by a multiplex real‐time PCR assay. Two different commercial assays were used during the study period, ""AusDiagnostics/Respiratory Pathogens 12 (AusDiagnostics)"" used between April 2011 and December 2015, which changed to ""Fast Track Diagnostics/Respiratory Pathogens 21 (Fast Track Diagnostics)"" after January 2016 to cover more viruses. Nucleic acid extraction was done by EZ1 Advanced XL platform (QIAGEN). Respiratory pathogens detected in 1857 of the 3162 (58.7%) samples. The most prevalent viruses during the 8‐year period were rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV; 36.2%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; 19%), and influenza virus A/B (14.7%). Rhinovirus was the main contributor to the RV/EV group as shown by the assay used during the 2016‐2018 period. RV/EV and adenoviruses detected throughout the year. Influenza virus was most frequently detected during January to March when both RSV and metapneumovirus were also in circulation. The coinfection percentage was 10.2%. Rhinovirus was the most common virus in coinfections while RSV plus rhinovirus/enterovirus were the most frequent combination.

A New Day: The Role of Telemedicine in Reshaping Care for Persons with Movement Disorders,"The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the fragility of clinic-based care for Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders. In response to the virus, many clinics across the world abruptly closed their doors to persons with Parkinson's disease. Fortunately, a niche care model, telemedicine-first described in this journal a generation ago-emerged as the dominant means of providing care. As we adjust to a new normal, we should focus future care not on clinics but on patients. Their needs, guided by clinicians, should determine how care is delivered, whether in the clinic, at home, remotely, or by some combination. Within this patient-centered approach, telemedicine is an attractive care option but not a complete replacement for in-person consultations, which are valuable for specific problems and for those who have access. Now that many clinicians and patients have gained exposure to telemedicine, we can better appreciate its advantages (eg, convenience) and disadvantages (eg, restricted examination). We can also create a new future that utilizes the Internet, video conferencing, smartphones, and sensors. This future will bring many clinicians to one patient, connect individual experts to countless patients, use widely available devices to facilitate diagnosis, and apply novel technologies to measure the disease in new ways. These approaches, which extend to education and research, enable a future where we can care for anyone anywhere and will help us stem the tide of Parkinson's disease. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""Patient-Centered Parkinson's Care: Leveraging Telemedicine for a Global Future""",3.79616641998291,0.30769230769230765,0.0,0.15384615384615383,0.018445540119318492,0.1592356687898089,0.9246171712875366
Climate Solutions Double as Health Interventions,"The climate crisis threatens to exacerbate numerous climate-sensitive health risks, including heatwave mortality, malnutrition from reduced crop yields, water- and vector-borne infectious diseases, and respiratory illness from smog, ozone, allergenic pollen, and wildfires. Recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stress the urgent need for action to mitigate climate change, underscoring the need for more scientific assessment of the benefits of climate action for health and wellbeing. Project Drawdown has analyzed more than 80 solutions to address climate change, building on existing technologies and practices, that could be scaled to collectively limit warming to between 1.5° and 2 °C above preindustrial levels. The solutions span nine major sectors and are aggregated into three groups: reducing the sources of emissions, maintaining and enhancing carbon sinks, and addressing social inequities. Here we present an overview of how climate solutions in these three areas can benefit human health through improved air quality, increased physical activity, healthier diets, reduced risk of infectious disease, and improved sexual and reproductive health, and universal education. We find that the health benefits of a low-carbon society are more substantial and more numerous than previously realized and should be central to policies addressing climate change. Much of the existing literature focuses on health effects in high-income countries, however, and more research is needed on health and equity implications of climate solutions, especially in the Global South.

The Role of Sugar Transporter CsSWEET7a in Apoplasmic Phloem Unloading in Receptacle and Nectary During Cucumber Anthesis,"During anthesis, there is an increased demand for carbohydrates due to pollen maturation and nectary secretion that warrants a systematic phloem unloading strategy for sugar partitioning. Sugar transporters are key components of the apoplasmic phloem unloading strategy and control the sugar flux needed for plant development. Currently, the phloem unloading strategy during anthesis has not been explored in cucumber, and the question of which sugar transporters are active during flower anthesis is poorly understood. In this study, a study utilizing the phloem-mobile symplasmic tracer carboxyfluorescein (CF) suggested that the phloem unloading was symplasmically isolated in the receptacle and nectary of cucumber flowers at anthesis. We also identified a hexose transporter that is highly expressed in cucumber flower, Sugar Will Eventually be Exported Transporter 7a (SWEET7a). CsSWEET7a was mainly expressed in receptacle and nectary tissues in both male and female flowers, where its expression level increased rapidly right before anthesis. At anthesis, the CsSWEET7a protein was specifically localized to the phloem region of the receptacle and nectary, indicating that CsSWEET7a may function in the apoplasmic phloem unloading during flower anthesis. Although cucumber mainly transports raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs) in the phloem, sucrose, glucose, and fructose are the major sugars in the flower receptacle and the nectary as well as in nectar at anthesis. In addition, the transcript levels of genes encoding soluble sugar hydrolases (α-galactosidase, sucrose synthase, cytoplasmic invertase, and cell wall invertase) were correlated with that of CsSWEET7a. These results indicated that CsSWEET7a may be involved in sugar partitioning as an exporter in the phloem of the receptacle and nectary to supply carbohydrates for flower anthesis and nectar secretion in cucumber.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"Title: ""Sugar Partitioning in Cucumber Flowers During Anthesis: Role of CsSWEET7a in Phloem Unloading""",4.8173909187316895,0.7096774193548386,0.20689655172413793,0.3870967741935484,0.046041060436544406,0.4671113044318786,0.9614338874816895

"Remotely delivered information, training and support for informal caregivers of people with dementia","BACKGROUND: Many people with dementia are cared for at home by unpaid informal caregivers, usually family members. Caregivers may experience a range of physical, emotional, financial and social harms, which are often described collectively as caregiver burden. The degree of burden experienced is associated with characteristics of the caregiver, such as gender, and characteristics of the person with dementia, such as dementia stage, and the presence of behavioural problems or neuropsychiatric disturbances. It is a strong predictor of admission to residential care for people with dementia. Psychoeducational interventions might prevent or reduce caregiver burden. Overall, they are intended to improve caregivers' knowledge about the disease and its care; to increase caregivers' sense of competence and their ability to cope with difficult situations; to relieve feelings of isolation and allow caregivers to attend to their own emotional and physical needs. These interventions are heterogeneous, varying in their theoretical framework, components, and delivery formats. Interventions that are delivered remotely, using printed materials, telephone or video technologies, may be particularly suitable for caregivers who have difficulty accessing face-to-face services because of their own health problems, poor access to transport, or absence of substitute care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, containment measures in many countries required people to be isolated in their homes, including people with dementia and their family carers. In such circumstances, there is no alternative to remote delivery of interventions. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and acceptability of remotely delivered interventions aiming to reduce burden and improve mood and quality of life of informal caregivers of people with dementia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, MEDLINE, Embase and four other databases, as well as two international trials registries, on 10 April 2020. We also examined the bibliographies of relevant review papers and published trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included only randomised controlled trials that assessed the remote delivery of structured interventions for informal caregivers who were providing care for people with dementia living at home. Caregivers had to be unpaid adults (relatives or members of the person's community). The interventions could be delivered using printed materials, the telephone, the Internet or a mixture of these, but could not involve any face-to-face contact with professionals. We categorised intervention components as information, training or support. Information interventions included two key elements: (i) they provided standardised information, and (ii) the caregiver played a passive role. Support interventions promoted interaction with other people (professionals or peers). Training interventions trained caregivers in practical skills to manage care. We excluded interventions that were primarily individual psychotherapy. Our primary outcomes were caregiver burden, mood, health-related quality of life and dropout for any reason. Secondary outcomes were caregiver knowledge and skills, use of health and social care resources, admission of the person with dementia to institutional care, and quality of life of the person with dementia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Study selection, data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias in included studies were done independently by two review authors. We used the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) to describe the interventions. We conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model to derive estimates of effect size. We used GRADE methods to describe our degree of certainty about effect estimates. MAIN RESULTS: We included 26 studies in this review (2367 participants). We compared (1) interventions involving training, support or both, with or without information (experimental interventions) with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control (12 studies, 944 participants); and (2) the same experimental interventions with provision of information alone (14 studies, 1423 participants). We downgraded evidence for study limitations and, for some outcomes, for inconsistency between studies. There was a frequent risk of bias from self-rating of subjective outcomes by participants who were not blind to the intervention. Randomisation methods were not always well-reported and there was potential for attrition bias in some studies. Therefore, all evidence was of moderate or low certainty. In the comparison of experimental interventions with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control, we found that the experimental interventions probably have little or no effect on caregiver burden (nine studies, 597 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.35 to 0.23); depressive symptoms (eight studies, 638 participants; SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.12); or health-related quality of life (two studies, 311 participants; SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.32). The experimental interventions probably result in little or no difference in dropout for any reason (eight studies, 661 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.53). In the comparison of experimental interventions with a control condition of information alone, we found that experimental interventions may result in a slight reduction in caregiver burden (nine studies, 650 participants; SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.51 to 0.04); probably result in a slight improvement in depressive symptoms (11 studies, 1100 participants; SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.06); may result in little or no difference in caregiver health-related quality of life (two studies, 257 participants; SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.21); and probably result in an increase in dropouts for any reason (12 studies, 1266 participants; RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.20). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Remotely delivered interventions including support, training or both, with or without information, may slightly reduce caregiver burden and improve caregiver depressive symptoms when compared with provision of information alone, but not when compared with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control. They seem to make little or no difference to health-related quality of life. Caregivers receiving training or support were more likely than those receiving information alone to drop out of the studies, which might limit applicability. The efficacy of these interventions may depend on the nature and availability of usual services in the study settings.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"Here's a possible title based on the abstract:

Drug repurposing and polypharmacology to fight SARS-CoV-2 through the inhibition of the main protease,"Therapeutic options are urgently needed to fight the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the COVID-19 disease and is spreading rapidly around the world. Drug repurposing can significantly accelerate the identification of drug candidates suitable for clinical evaluation. Moreover, polypharmacological effects may increase antiviral activity and/or counteract severe complications concurrently affecting COVID-19 patients. Herein, we present the results of a computational drug repurposing campaign in search of potential inhibitors of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The screening allowed the selection of 22 promising drugs. Some of them have already entered clinical trials, but the vast majority of the identified compounds are new and have never been considered before. For each repurposed compound, its therapeutic relevance and potential beneficial polypharmacological effects that may arise due to its original therapeutic indication are thoroughly discussed.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""Computational Drug Repurposing for COVID-19: Identifying Potential Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease""",3.4062798023223877,0.5161290322580646,0.2758620689655172,0.45161290322580644,0.043748114312246456,0.36249014972419225,0.9578545093536377
Jumper Enables Discontinuous Transcript Assembly in Coronaviruses,"Genes in SARS-CoV-2 and, more generally, in viruses in the order of Nidovirales are expressed by a process of discontinuous transcription mediated by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This process is distinct from alternative splicing in eukaryotes, rendering current transcript assembly methods unsuitable to Nidovirales sequencing samples. Here, we introduce the Discontinuous Transcript Assembly problem of finding transcripts and their abundances c given an alignment under a maximum likelihood model that accounts for varying transcript lengths. Underpinning our approach is the concept of a segment graph, a directed acyclic graph that, distinct from the splice graph used to characterize alternative splicing, has a unique Hamiltonian path. We provide a compact characterization of solutions as subsets of non-overlapping edges in this graph, enabling the formulation of an efficient mixed integer linear program. We show using simulations that our method, Jumper, drastically outperforms existing methods for classical transcript assembly. On short-read data of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 samples, we find that Jumper not only identifies canonical transcripts that are part of the reference transcriptome, but also predicts expression of non-canonical transcripts that are well supported by direct evidence from long-read data, presence in multiple, independent samples or a conserved core sequence. Jumper enables detailed analyses of Nidovirales transcriptomes.

The burden of type 2 diabetes pre-and during the COVID-19 pandemic – a review,"INTRODUCTION: Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic disease and a global epidemic. It is a known fact that co-morbidities, including Diabetes Mellitus, pose a higher risk of infection by COVID-19. Additionally, the outcomes following infection are far worse than in people without such co-morbities. Factors contributing to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have long been established, yet this disease still bestows a substantial global burden. The aim was to provide a comprehensive review of the burden of diabetes pre-COVID-19 and the additional impact sustained by the diabetes population and healthcare systems during the COVID-19 pandemic, while providing recommendations of how this burden can be subsided. METHODOLOGY: Literature searches were carried out on ‘Google Scholar’ and ‘PubMed’ to identify relevant articles for the scope of this review. Information was also collected from reliable sources such as the World Health Organisation and the International Diabetes Federation. RESULTS: T2DM presented with economic, social and health burdens prior to COVID-19 with an significant ‘Disability Adjusted Life Years’ impact. Whilst people with diabetes are more susceptible to COVID-19, enforcing lockdown regulations set by the Public Health department to reduce risk of infection brought about its own challenges to T2DM management. Through recommendations and adapting to new methods of management such as telehealth, these challenges and potential consequences of mismanagement are kept to a minimum whilst safeguarding the healthcare system. CONCLUSION: By understanding the challenges and burdens faced by this population both evident pre-covid and during, targeted healthcare can be provided during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, implementation of targeted action plans and recommendations ensures the care provided is done in a safe and effective environment.

An Update on the Role of Nrf2 in Respiratory Disease: Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Approaches,"Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) is a transcriptional activator of the cell protection gene that binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE). Therefore, Nrf2 protects cells and tissues from oxidative stress. Normally, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) inhibits the activation of Nrf2 by binding to Nrf2 and contributes to Nrf2 break down by ubiquitin proteasomes. In moderate oxidative stress, Keap1 is inhibited, allowing Nrf2 to be translocated to the nucleus, which acts as an antioxidant. However, under unusually severe oxidative stress, the Keap1-Nrf2 mechanism becomes disrupted and results in cell and tissue damage. Oxide-containing atmospheric environment generally contributes to the development of respiratory diseases, possibly leading to the failure of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. Until now, several studies have identified changes in Keap1-Nrf2 signaling in models of respiratory diseases, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)/acute lung injury (ALI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and asthma. These studies have confirmed that several Nrf2 activators can alleviate symptoms of respiratory diseases. Thus, this review describes how the expression of Keap1-Nrf2 functions in different respiratory diseases and explains the protective effects of reversing this expression.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""Nrf2-Keap1 Pathway in Respiratory Diseases: A Review of Oxidative Stress and Protection Mechanisms""",2.797121286392212,0.4827586206896552,0.14814814814814817,0.3448275862068965,0.0342347495586902,0.3966836734693877,0.9343444108963013
Self-flip Technique of the TightRope RT Button for Soft-Tissue Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.,"The TightRope RT (Arthrex, Naples, FL) is a suspensory device for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. However, there is a potential risk of the button being pulled too far off the lateral femoral cortex into the soft tissue because the adjustable loop is long. The purpose of this article is to present an easy and safe technique for self-flip. As to the preparation of the graft, we draw the first line in the loop of the TightRope RT at the same length as the femoral tunnel, and we draw the second line 7 mm longer than the length of the femoral tunnel as a self-flip line. Concerning passing of the graft, the side sutures are pulled from the lateral side. We stop pulling the sutures just at the self-flip line by holding the graft at the tibial end. The side suture is inclined to the medial side with strong pulling of the suture at full extension of the knee. Then the surgeon pulls the tibial end of the graft to feel a secure positioning of the button on the lateral femoral cortex. Although it has limitations, the present technique is easy and certainly helps surgeons achieve appropriate positioning of the button.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""Easy and Safe Technique for TightRope RT Button Positioning in ACL Reconstruction""",2.7853810787200928,0.4444444444444445,0.16,0.3703703703703704,0.08406863224415036,0.3650793650793651,0.9383333325386047
Environmental implications of reduced electricity consumption in Wuhan during COVID-19 outbreak: A brief study,"Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Wuhan was locked down from 23 January 2020 to 8 April 2020, a total of 76 days. It is well known that the electricity consumption is a direct reflection of human activity. During the lockdown of Wuhan, most of human activities were forbidden. The reduction in human activity would inevitably lead to a reduction in electricity consumption. At the same time, anthropogenic emissions of air pollutants would also be reduced with the reduction of human activity. In this study, the correlation between electricity consumption and air pollutants during lockdown was discussed in detail. The result showed that the drop in pollutants concentrations in January should be attributed to the washout effect of rainfall rather than the lockdown. The decrease of electricity consumption in the secondary industry might play a significant role on the decrease of PM [Formula: see text] and NO(2) concentrations in Wuhan in February 2020. The decrease in NO(2) concentration in March should be attributed to the reduction of pollutants emissions from the tertiary industry, which means that more attention should be paid to the control of NO(2) emission in the tertiary industry. Due to reduced emissions from local sources, the role of long-range transport sources might be more significant during the lockdown of Wuhan. By PSCF analysis, southeast of Wuhan could be the major potential emission sources of PM [Formula: see text] , especially in the northern part of Jiangxi province. It was suggested that stricter regulation of pollutants emissions should be implemented in this area.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""Correlation between Electricity Consumption and Air Pollutants during the Wuhan Lockdown""",4.22692084312439,0.30769230769230765,0.08333333333333333,0.23076923076923075,0.033502031395306775,0.21326013513513511,0.9447389245033264
"Radiological manifestations from 101 patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in Hamadan, West of Iran: Typical and atypical findings","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread widely throughout the world and become a pandemic disease. In this study we decided to investigate the chest computed tomography (CT) findings in COVID-19 patients in Hamadan, west of Iran. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted on 101 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from February to March 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and chest CT information of identified COVID-19 patients were assessed. Results Totally, 101 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. The mean age of the patients was 55.21 ± 14.08 years and 54% (53.47%) of them were male. With regards to clinical manifestations, 82.18%, 72.28% and 54.46% of COVID-19 patients had dry cough, dyspnea and fever, respectively and 44.5% had lymphopenia. The right lower lobe was the most common (69%) and severe involved lobe followed by left lower lobe, right middle lobe, and lingual;however, anterior segment of upper lobes showed least involvement with abnormality in the late course of disease. The most common pattern is ground glass opacity, but atypical patterns such as round pneumonia, moderate to severe plural effusion and segmental lobar collapse consolidation was seen without evidence of mediastinal adenopathy, cavitation or nodule. Chest X ray (CXR) was not sensitive method as a first line imaging because 34.65% of them were normal. Conclusion CXR is not sensitive method as first line imaging too (34.65% normal first CXR), but Chest CT is very sensitive and nonspecific modality for diagnosis of COVID – 19.

Structural architecture of an RNA that competitively inhibits RNase L.,"Activation of RNase L endonuclease activity is part of the mammalian innate immune response to viral infection. The poliovirus RNA genome contains a sequence in its protein-coding region that can act as a competitive inhibitor of RNase L. Mutation, sequence, and functional analysis of this competitive inhibitor RNA (ciRNA) revealed that its activity depends on specific sequences, showed that a loop-loop hairpin interaction forms in the ciRNA, and suggested the presence of a loop E motif. These features lead to the hypothesis that the ciRNA's function is conferred in part by a specific three-dimensional folded RNA architecture. By using a combination of biophysical, mutational, and functional studies, we have mapped features of the three-dimensional architecture of the ciRNA in its unbound form. We show that the loop-loop interaction forms in the free ciRNA and affects the overall structure, perhaps forming long-range tertiary interactions with the loop E motif. Local tight RNA-RNA backbone packing occurs in parts of the structure, but the fold appears to be less stable than many other tightly packed RNAs. This feature may allow the ciRNA to accommodate the translocation of ribosomes and polymerase across this multifunctional region of the viral RNA but also to function as an RNase L inhibitor.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""Structural Analysis of the Competitive Inhibitor RNA (ciRNA) in Poliovirus""",3.8483147621154785,0.4000000000000001,0.0,0.3,0.018798317647335087,0.17699115044247787,0.9270238876342773
"Heard, valued, supported? Doctors' wellbeing during transitions triggered by COVID‐19","INTRODUCTION: Supporting doctors' wellbeing is crucial for medical education to help minimise negative long‐term impacts on medical workforce retention and ultimately patient care. There is limited study of how doctors' transitions experiences impact wellbeing, particularly socially and culturally. Multiple Multidimensional Transitions (MMT) theory views transitions as dynamic, incorporating multiple contexts and multiple domains. Using MMT as our lens, we report a qualitative analysis of how transitions experienced by doctors during the pandemic impacted on social and cultural aspects of wellbeing. METHODS: Longitudinal narrative inquiry was employed, using interviews and audio‐diaries. Data were collected over 6 months in three phases: (i) interviews with doctors from across the career spectrum (n = 98); (ii) longitudinal audio‐diaries for 2–4 months (n = 71); (iii) second interviews (n = 83). Data were analysed abductively, narrowing focus to factors important to social and cultural wellbeing. RESULTS: Doctors described experiencing multiple interacting transitions triggered by the pandemic in multiple contexts (workplace, role, homelife and education). Patterns identifiable across the dataset allowed us to explore social and cultural wellbeing crosscutting beyond individual experience. Three critical factors contributed to social and cultural wellbeing both positively and negatively: being heard (e.g., by colleagues asking how they are); being valued (e.g., removal of rest spaces by organisations showing lack of value); and being supported (e.g., through regular briefing by education bodies). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to longitudinally explore the multiple‐multidimensional transitions experienced by doctors during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Our data analysis helped us move beyond existing perceptions around wellbeing and articulate multiple factors that contribute to social and cultural wellbeing. It is vital that medical educators consider the learning from these experiences to help pinpoint what aspects of support might be beneficial to trainee doctors and their trainers. This study forms the basis for developing evidenced‐based interventions that ensure doctors are heard, valued and supported.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"Here's a possible title based on the abstract:

"Youth athletes sleep more, practice less, and may lose interest in playing sports due to social distancing mandates","In-person sport participation was suspended across the United States in the spring of 2020 to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The purpose of this study was to survey the impact of COVID-19 on young athletes during a period of social and organized sports restrictions. An anonymous cross-sectional survey study was conducted of youth athletes in the midst of social distancing mandates and consisted of six components: demographics, sport participation, changes in sport-related goals/aspirations, sleep habits, and measures of anxiety and depression. 711 individuals who accessed the survey link yielded 575 (81%) participants with responses available for analysis. All respondents (aged 13.0 years) played organized sports, 62% were single-sport athletes, and 74% considered high-level. Participants were training ∼3.3 h less per week, spending more time outside, and 86% of participants continued to train while social distancing. Sleep duration increased (∼1.2 h/night) and sleep quality improved in 29% of young athletes.

Impact of COVID-19 on Canadian medical oncologists and cancer care: Canadian Association of Medical Oncologists survey report,"Background: The covid-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented professional and personal challenges for the oncology community. Under the auspices of the Canadian Association of Medical Oncologists, we conducted an online national survey to better understand the impact of the pandemic on the medical oncology community in Canada. Methods: An English-language multiple-choice survey, including questions about demographics, covid-19 risk, use of personal protective equipment (ppe), personal challenges, and chemotherapy management was distributed to Canadian medical oncologists. The survey was open from 30 March to 4 April 2020, and attracted 159 responses. Results: More than 70% of medical oncologists expressed moderate-to-extreme concern about personally contracting covid-19 and about family members or patients (or both) contracting covid-19 from them. Despite that high level of concern, considerable variability in the use of ppe in direct cancer care was reported at the time of this survey, with 33% of respondents indicating no routine ppe use at their institutions and 69% indicating uncertainty about access to adequate ppe. Of the respondents, 54% were experiencing feelings of nervousness or anxiety on most days, and 52% were having feelings of depression or hopelessness on at least some days. Concern about aging parents or family and individual wellness represented the top personal challenges identified. The management of cancer patients has been affected, with adoption of telemedicine reported by 82% of respondents, and cessation of clinical trial accrual reported by 54%. The 3 factors deemed most important for treatment decision-making wereâ cancer prognosis and anticipated benefit from treatment,â risk of treatment toxicity during scarce health care access, andâ patient risk of contracting covid-19. Conclusions: This report describes the results of the first national survey assessing the impact of the covid-19 on Canadian medical oncologists and how they deliver systemic anticancer therapies. We hope that these data will provide a framework to address the challenges identified.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"Title: ""Impact of COVID-19 on Canadian Medical Oncologists: A National Survey""",4.344386339187622,0.6,0.5,0.6,0.3488679467480158,0.3888540140894189,0.9528496861457825
High diversity in Delta variant across countries revealed by genome‐wide analysis of SARS‐CoV‐2 beyond the Spike protein,"The highly contagious Delta variant of SARS‐CoV‐2 has become a prevalent strain globally and poses a public health challenge around the world. While there has been extensive focus on understanding the amino acid mutations in the Delta variant’s Spike protein, the mutational landscape of the rest of the SARS‐CoV‐2 proteome (25 proteins) remains poorly understood. To this end, we performed a systematic analysis of mutations in all the SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins from nearly 2 million SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes from 176 countries/territories. Six highly prevalent missense mutations in the viral life cycle‐associated Membrane (I82T), Nucleocapsid (R203M, D377Y), NS3 (S26L), and NS7a (V82A, T120I) proteins are almost exclusive to the Delta variant compared to other variants of concern (mean prevalence across genomes: Delta = 99.74%, Alpha = 0.06%, Beta = 0.09%, and Gamma = 0.22%). Furthermore, we find that the Delta variant harbors a more diverse repertoire of mutations across countries compared to the previously dominant Alpha variant. Overall, our study underscores the high diversity of the Delta variant between countries and identifies a list of amino acid mutations in the Delta variant’s proteome for probing the mechanistic basis of pathogenic features such as high viral loads, high transmissibility, and reduced susceptibility against neutralization by vaccines.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""Systematic Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant Mutations Across 2 Million Genomes""",2.8167219161987305,0.5454545454545455,0.3225806451612903,0.30303030303030304,0.03611948985310407,0.2686746987951807,0.9580358862876892
Biospecimen Collection During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Considerations for Biobanking,"OBJECTIVES: Millions of biospecimens will be collected during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As learned from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), proper biospecimen handling is necessary to prevent laboratory-related infections. METHODS: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) interim biosafety guidelines continue to be updated. Presented here are additional considerations intended to complement the interim guidance. These considerations draw on prior SARS recommendations and recent COVID-19 reports. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has been detected in various biospecimen types; however, studies are needed to determine whether viral load indicates viable virus. Throughout the pandemic, biospecimens will be collected for various purposes from COVID-19 known and suspected cases, as well as presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Current data suggest the pandemic start may be as early as October 2019; thus, all biospecimens collected since could be considered potentially infectious. CONCLUSIONS: All entities handling these biospecimens should do risk assessments in accordance with institutional policies and adhere to any guidance provided. The scientific community has a responsibility to safely handle and maintain all biospecimens collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Soon, it will be imperative to convene expert working groups to address the current and long-term storage and use of these biospecimens. Ideally, worldwide guidelines will be established to protect the personnel handling these biospecimens and communities at large.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""Ensuring Safe Handling of COVID-19 Biospecimens: A Call for Global Guidelines""",4.769749641418457,0.3636363636363636,0.09999999999999999,0.2727272727272727,0.018798317647335087,0.19230769230769232,0.9427001476287842
"SARS‐CoV nucleocapsid protein binds to hUbc9, a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme of the sumoylation system","SARS‐CoV is a newly identified coronavirus (CoV) that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The SARS‐CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein is an important structural and functional protein. To identify cellular proteins that interact with the SARS‐CoV N protein and to elucidate the possible involvement of N protein in SARS‐CoV pathogenesis, a human lymphocyte cDNA library was screened using a yeast two‐hybrid system assay. hUbc9, a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme of sumoylation system, was found to interact specifically with the N protein, implying the post‐translational sumoylation of the N protein. Mapping studies localized the critical N sequences for this interaction to amino acids 170–210, which includes the SR‐rich motif. However, the consensus motif of sumoylation GK(62)EE in the N protein is not responsible for binding to hUbc9. Mutations of hUbc9 at the enzyme active site C93A or C93S severely impair the interaction with the N protein. The two proteins were also shown to colocalize in the cytoplasm of the transfected 293T cells. This is the first report demonstrating the interaction of hUbc9 with a structural protein of plus‐strand RNA viruses, indicating a new drug target for SARS‐CoV. J. Med.

The Extent of Myocardial Injury During Prolonged Targeted Temperature Management After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest.,"AIM The aim of this study is to evaluate the extent of myocardial injury by cardiac biomarkers during prolonged targeted temperature management of 24 hours vs 48 hours after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. METHODS This randomized Scandinavian multicenter study compares the extent of myocardial injury quantified by area under the curve (AUC) of cardiac biomarkers during prolonged targeted temperature management at 33°C ± 1°C of 24 hours and 48 hours, respectively. Through a period of 2.5 years, 161 comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients were randomized to targeted temperature management for 24 hours (n = 77) or 48 hours (n = 84). The AUC was calculated using both high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnTAUC) and creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MBAUC) that were based upon measurements of these biomarkers every 6 hours upon admission until 96 hours after reaching target temperature. RESULTS The median hs-cTnTAUC of 33,827 ng/L/h (interquartile range [IQR] 11,366-117,690) of targeted temperature management at 24 hours did not differ significantly from that of 28,973 ng/L/h (IQR 10,656-163,655) at 48 hours. In contrast, the median CK-MBAUC of 1829 μg/L/h (IQR 800-6799) during targeted temperature management at 24 hours was significantly lower than that of 2428 μg/L/h (IQR 1163-10,906) within targeted temperature management at 48 hours, P <.05. CONCLUSION This study of comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors showed no difference between the extents of myocardial injury estimated by hs-cTnTAUC of prolonged targeted temperature management of 48 hours vs 24 hours, although the CK-MBAUC was significantly higher during 48 hours vs 24 hours. Hence, it seems unlikely that the duration of targeted temperature management has a beneficial effect on the extent of myocardial injury after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and may even have a worsening effect.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"Title: ""Comparing Myocardial Injury in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Patients Undergoing 24 vs 48 Hours of Targeted Temperature Management""",4.900043725967407,0.6111111111111112,0.4117647058823529,0.38888888888888884,0.0889696287266969,0.5515986071541626,0.9673119783401489
Online Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for People with Parkinson’s Disease and Their Caregivers: a Pilot Study,"Anxiety and depression are common non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Caregivers of people with PD may experience severe caregiver burden. This study explored the feasibility and potential benefits of an online mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) intervention for improving anxiety and depressive symptoms in people with PD and their caregivers (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04469049, 7/8/2020). People with PD or parkinsonism and anxiety and/or depressive symptoms and caregivers of people with PD participated in one of three online MBCT groups. Demographic variables, pre- and post-MBCT behavioral measures (GAD-7, PHQ-9, Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire — FFMQ-15, Caregiver Self-Assessment Questionnaire — CSAQ), and satisfaction surveys were collected. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data. Pre- and post-MBCT behavioral scores were compared using mixed-effect models. Fifty-six potential participants were assessed for eligibility. Twenty-eight entered MBCT groups; all but one completed the intervention. The overall sample analyzed (22 people with PD, 4 caregivers) showed significant GAD-7 and PHQ-9 score reductions and FFMQ-15 total and observing and non-reactivity subscale score increases (all p’s < 0.05). Participants with PD and anxiety symptoms (n = 14) had a significant GAD-7 score reduction; those with PD and depressive symptoms (n = 12) had a significant PHQ-9 score reduction (both p’s < 0.05). Participants with PD also had a significant FFMQ-15 observing subscale score increase (p < 0.05). The caregiver sample was too small to be analyzed separately. Online MBCT is feasible (as measured by high attendance, completion rate, and participant satisfaction) and may be effective in improving anxiety and depressive symptoms in people with PD.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""Evaluating the Feasibility and Efficacy of Online Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Parkinson's Disease and Caregivers""",4.807685136795044,0.6470588235294118,0.5,0.6470588235294118,0.24623953025272619,0.4780521262002744,0.966301441192627

The COVID-19 multiplier effects of tourism on the Greek economy,"Using a multisectoral model and data from the Supply and Use Tables, this article estimates the COVID-19 multiplier effects of tourism on gross domestic product (GDP), total employment, and trade balance of the Greek economy. The results indicate that a—not-unexpected—decrease of international travel receipts in the range of 3.5 to 10.5 billion euros would lead to a decrease in GDP of about 2.0% to 6.0%, a decrease in the levels of employment of about 2.1% to 6.4% and an increase in the trade balance deficit of about 2.4 to 7.1 billion euros, respectively.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""COVID-19's Impact on the Greek Economy: Tourism Multiplier Effects""",0.9290289878845215,0.8181818181818182,0.5,0.5454545454545454,0.24712442545253582,0.7281553398058254,0.9602546691894531
Predicting compassion fatigue among psychological hotline counselors using machine learning techniques,"During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019, psychological hotline counselors frequently address help-seekers’ traumatic experiences from time to time, which possibly causes counselors’ compassion fatigue. The present study aimed to explore the predictors of compassion fatigue among a high-risk population of psychological hotline counselors. Seven hundred and twelve psychological hotline counselors were recruited from the Mental Health Service Platform at Central China Normal University, Ministry of Education, then were asked to complete the questionnaires measuring compassion fatigue, trait empathy, social support, trait mindfulness, counselor’s self-efficacy, humor, life meaning, and post-traumatic growth. A chi-square test was utilized to filter for the top-20 predictive variables. Machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and naïve Bayes were employed to predict compassion fatigue. The results showed that the most important predictors of compassion fatigue were meaning in life, counselors’ self-efficacy, mindfulness, and empathy. Except for the decision tree, the rest machine learning techniques obtained good performance. Naïve Bayes presented the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.803. Random forest achieved the least classification error of 23.64, followed by Naïve Bayes with a classification error of 23.85. These findings support the potential application of machine learning techniques in the prediction of compassion fatigue.

The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among asymptomatic blood donors in Saudi Arabia,"BACKGROUND: In late 2019, cases of severe pneumonia with unidentified etiology began to emerge in Wuhan, China, before progressively spreading first nationally and then globally. The current study sought to investigate the seroprevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among blood donors in Al-Madinah, Saudi Arabia. To our knowledge, this is the first study in Saudi Arabia to screen blood donors who were not known to be previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional study to assess individuals who donated blood to the central blood bank in Al-Madinah between mid-May and mid-July 2020. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was designed and established to detect antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in serum samples. A total of 1,212 healthy blood donors participated in this study. The donors were males and met the requirements for blood donation during the COVID-19 pandemic period in Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among blood donors in Al-Madinah was 19.31% (n = 234/1212; 95% confidence interval: 17.12%–21.64%). No statistically significant difference was identified in seropositivity according to age. However, significant differences (p < 0.001) were identified according to ABO blood groups, with those with type A blood presenting the highest rate of seropositivity (29.18%) compared with the other blood groups (12.65% for type B, 16.36% for type AB, and 15.11% for type O). CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was detected among blood donors in Al-Madinah, which indicated a high level of exposure to the virus within the population. This further suggested that as high as one-fifth of the population may have acquired innate immunity against the virus.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"""SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Among Blood Donors in Al-Madinah, Saudi Arabia""",3.7917420864105225,0.7407407407407408,0.4,0.6666666666666665,0.10968758973515394,0.544452519379845,0.9639337062835693
Residual Respiratory Impairment After COVID-19 Pneumonia,"Introduction: the Novel Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19) can infect the respiratory tract, causing mild to deadly respiratory impairment. It is still unknown whether patients recovering from Covid-19 will develop respiratory sequelae. This study aims to evaluate the respiratory and functional condition of Covid-19 recovered patients, stratified according to their worst p/F during hospitalization for Covid-19. Method: 86 Covid-19 recovered subjects performed, after 39 days on average, physical examination and arterial blood gas (ABG) examination, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) with diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco), and six-minute walk test (6MWT). Subjects also quantified their dyspnoea and cough using a visual analogic scale (VAS) at three-time points: previously than COVID infection, during COVID hospitalization, and currently. The 76 subjects with reliable ABG during the hospitalization were stratified in three groups according to their worst PaO2/FiO2 ratio (p/F): “mild”: p/F>300 (n = 38);“moderate”: 200<p/F<300 (n = 30), “severe” p/F < 200 (n = 20). Results: In this cohort, Covid-19 recovered subjects still reported significant residual dyspnoea at the visit time. The severe subjects group showed a lower Total Lung Capacity (TLC), a lower DLco, and a worse 6MWT performance. Conclusion: After Covid-19, respiratory and functional impairments may persist. These impairments seem to be more severe as much as minor was the patient worst p/F during hospitalization. These patients should receive a strict follow-up.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title,"Title: ""Residual Respiratory Impairments in Covid-19 Recovered Patients: A Stratified Analysis""",3.8430519104003906,0.5263157894736842,0.3529411764705882,0.5263157894736842,0.030934588294313718,0.5434782608695652,0.9225185513496399
