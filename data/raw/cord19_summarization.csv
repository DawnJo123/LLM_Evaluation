183. Decrease in Invasive Pneumococcal Disease in 7 United States Children’s Hospitals during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"BACKGROUND: During the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, physical distancing and mask use guidelines were implemented resulting in a decline in the number of infections caused by influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and otitis media. A surveillance analysis from England and Taiwan showed a decline in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) (Clin Infect Dis. 2021;72: e65-75 and J Infect. 2021;82:296-297). We hypothesized that COVID mitigation efforts resulted in a decrease in incidence of pediatric IPD within the U.S. during 2020 compared to previous years. METHODS: We reviewed all cases of IPD among 7 children’s hospitals from the U.S. Pediatric Multicenter Pneumococcal Surveillance Group from 2017-2020. IPD was defined by the isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from normally sterile sites (eg. blood, cerebrospinal, pleural, synovial or peritoneal fluid). Pneumococcal pneumonia was defined as an abnormal chest radiograph in the presence of a positive blood, pleural fluid or lung culture. Mastoiditis was identified by positive middle ear, subperiosteal abscess or mastoid bone culture. Serotypes were determined by the capsular swelling method. Hospital admission numbers were obtained for incidence calculations. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA11. A p< 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 410 IPD cases were identified. The cumulative incidence of IPD (0-22 years of age) decreased from 99.2/100,000 admissions in 2017-2019 to 53.8/100,000 admissions in 2020 (risk ratio 0.54, CI: 0.40-0.72, p< 0.00001). Pneumococcal bacteremia and pneumonia decreased significantly in 2020 (p< 0.05), and although not statistically significant, there were fewer cases of meningitis and mastoiditis when compared to previous years (p=0.08) (Figure 1). Sex, race, age or presence of comorbidities were not significantly different between groups. Most common serotypes in 2020 were 35B, 3 and 15B/C (Figure 2). [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The observed decline in IPD cases during the first year of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is likely associated with mask use and physical distancing limiting transmission of S. pneumoniae via droplets and viral infections frequently preceding IPD. These precautions might be useful in the future to decrease IPD, especially in high-risk patients. DISCLOSURES: Sheldon L. Kaplan, MD, Pfizer (Research Grant or Support) Tina Q.

CD10 in the developing human kidney: immunoreactivity and possible role in renal embryogenesis.,"CD10 was first identified in tumor cells of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Most studies on CD10 expression have dealt with tumor pathology. Since no data are available for specific role in the fetal kidney, this study aimed at investigating CD10 expression during the different phases of renal embryogenesis. To this end, the expression of CD10 was evaluated in the kidney of two human fetus and in three newborns. In both fetuses, immunostaining for CD10 was compartmentalized and mainly concentrated in the mid-deep cortex. Reactivity for CD10 was stronger in the glomerular epithelium, in proximal tubules and in metanephric mesenchymal cells. At 25 weeks of gestation, CD10 was also detected in the subcapsular regions, including some pretubular aggregates of cap mesenchymal cells and renal vesicles. At 34 weeks of gestation, we observed an increased immunoreactivity for CD10 in visceral and parietal glomerular epithelium. At 39 weeks of gestation, CD10 was also expressed in the collecting tubules and in the Henle loops. Our data show a strong expression of CD10 in all stage of human kidney development, characterized by dynamic changes and support the hypothesis that CD10 plays a relevant role in renal embryogenesis.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Long-term bone and lung consequences associated with hospital-acquired severe acute respiratory syndrome: a 15-year follow-up from a prospective cohort study.,"The most severe sequelae after rehabilitation from SARS are femoral head necrosis and pulmonary fibrosis. We performed a 15-year follow-up on the lung and bone conditions of SARS patients. We evaluated the recovery from lung damage and femoral head necrosis in an observational cohort study of SARS patients using pulmonary CT scans, hip joint MRI examinations, pulmonary function tests and hip joint function questionnaires. Eighty medical staff contracted SARS in 2003. Two patients died of SARS, and 78 were enrolled in this study from August 2003 to March 2018. Seventy-one patients completed the 15-year follow-up. The percentage of pulmonary lesions on CT scans diminished from 2003 (9.40 ± 7.83)% to 2004 (3.20 ± 4.78)% (P < 0.001) and remained stable thereafter until 2018 (4.60 ± 6.37)%. Between 2006 and 2018, the proportion of patients with interstitial changes who had improved pulmonary function was lower than that of patients without lesions, as demonstrated by the one-second ratio (FEV1/FVC%, t = 2.21, P = 0.04) and mid-flow of maximum expiration (FEF25%-75%, t = 2.76, P = 0.01). The volume of femoral head necrosis decreased significantly from 2003 (38.83 ± 21.01)% to 2005 (30.38 ± 20.23)% (P = 0.000 2), then declined slowly from 2005 to 2013 (28.99 ± 20.59)% and plateaued until 2018 (25.52 ± 15.51)%. Pulmonary interstitial damage and functional decline caused by SARS mostly recovered, with a greater extent of recovery within 2 years after rehabilitation. Femoral head necrosis induced by large doses of steroid pulse therapy in SARS patients was not progressive and was partially reversible.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
RNA structure interactions and ribonucleoprotein processes of the influenza A virus,"In one more years, we will ‘celebrate’ an exact centenary of the Spanish flu pandemic. With the rapid evolution of the influenza virus, the possibility of novel pandemic remains ever a concern. This review covers our current knowledge of the influenza A virus: on the role of RNA in translation, replication, what is known of the expressed proteins and the protein products generated from alternative splicing, and on the role of base pairing in RNA structure. We highlight the main events associated with viral entry into the cell, the transcription and replication process, an export of the viral genetic material from the nucleus and the final release of the virus. We discuss the observed potential roles of RNA secondary structure (the RNA base-pairing arrangement) and RNA/RNA interactions in this scheme.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Perspectives of social entrepreneurship in Romania in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,"The usual and rather linear functioning of a country's economic and social structures is mandatory for setting stable grounds towards wellbeing. However, disruptions may appear in the ordinary flow of a community and produce a new order of action, prompting social ecosystems to focus on core operations. The COVID-19 pandemic, that has profoundly affected humanity in 2020 on multiple channels, has imposed a novel strategic thinking both for individuals and businesses, demanding an enhanced societal approach more than ever. Faced with such a major crisis, known in literature as a ""black swan"" event, social enterprises must show developed capabilities, flexibility and proactivity. Given the inaccurate evidence of social enterprises activating in Romania and of the limited studies focusing on their risk-response behavior, the paper explores the impact triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic over social entrepreneurship and in particular on Romanian social enterprises. To investigate the ability of these entities to successfully cope with this groundbreaking challenge, the paper firstly performs a literature review analysis on the reorganization of the social and economic sphere, in light of the pandemic. Furthermore, it approaches the challenges posed by the pandemic on traditional and social entrepreneurship, together with their reshaping of organizational resilience. Building on literature review and on document analysis of reports regarding essential actions to be embraced to maintain stability during the COVID-19 crisis, issued by renowned consultancy companies and organizations supporting social enterprises, the paper formulates an instrument for mapping the ability of Romanian social enterprises to overcome the pandemic threats.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Work and worker health in the post-pandemic world: a public health perspective,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of work in shaping population health and wellbeing. This Viewpoint applies a multilevel systems framework to assist in understanding the diverse and complex interactions of forces affecting worker health and wellbeing, and how trending changes in employment and working conditions have been accelerated by the pandemic. Government agencies concerned with population health and wellbeing, and economic activity must expand their capacity to monitor, evaluate, and respond to these trends. In addition, integrated enterprise and workplace-based approaches that consider the interactions among these multidimensional drivers will build organisation and worker resilience to navigate the continual changes in work and worker safety, health, and wellbeing in a post-pandemic world.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
The impact of COVID-19 on unemployment rate: An intelligent based unemployment rate prediction in selected countries of Europe,"Abstract Unemployment remains a major cause for both developed and developing nations, due to which they lose their financial and economic impact as a whole Unemployment rate prediction achieved researcher attention from a fast few years The intention of doing our research is to examine the impact of the coronavirus on the unemployment rate Accurately predicting the unemployment rate is a stimulating job for policymakers, which plays an imperative role in a country's financial and financial development planning Classical time series models such as ARIMA models and advanced non-linear time series methods be previously hired for unemployment rate prediction It is known to us that mostly these data sets are non-linear as well as non-stationary Consequently, a random error can be produced by a distinct time series prediction model Our research considers hybrid prediction approaches supported by linear and non-linear models to preserve forecast the unemployment rates much precisely These hybrid approaches of the unemployment rate can advance their estimates by reproducing the unemployment ratio irregularity These models' appliance is exposed to six unemployment rate statistics sets from Europe's selected countries, specifically France, Spain, Belgium, Turkey, Italy and Germany Among these hybrid models, the hybrid ARIMA-ARNN forecasting model performed well for France, Belgium, Turkey and Germany, whereas hybrid ARIMA-SVM performed outclass for Spain and Italy Furthermore, these models are used for the best future prediction Results show that the unemployment rate will be higher in the coming years, which is the consequence of the coronavirus, and it will take at least 5?years to overcome the impact of COVID-19 in these countries",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
‘Feeling Fat’ Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic: Examining the Role of Emotion Dysregulation in the Body Displacement Hypothesis (preprint)/ en,"‘Feeling fat,’ the somatic experience of being overweight not entirely explained by objective weight, may occur due to the projection of negative affect onto the body. Individuals may manage ‘feeling fat’ via eating pathology (e.g., binge eating or dietary restriction) rather than address the source of negative affect. Thus, ‘feeling fat’ may occur in the absence of adaptive emotion regulation strategies. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased negative affect widely and may potentially contribute to the experience of ‘feeling fat’ and eating pathology among individuals with emotion dysregulation. This study examined whether emotion dysregulation moderates ‘feeling fat’s role as a mechanism underlying the relationship between COVID-19-related distress and eating pathology. This uniqueness of this model to eating pathology was investigated by comparing effects for binge eating and dietary restriction versus anxiety, depression, and problematic alcohol use. Structural equation modelling was used to analyze questionnaire data from 877 participants (77.3% women). ‘Feeling fat’ explained significant variance in the relationship between COVID-19-related distress and both binge eating and restriction. Emotion dysregulation moderated the strength of these relationships. However, ‘feeling fat’s role in the relationship between pandemic-related distress and negative psychological outcomes was not unique to eating pathology and did not vary based upon emotion dysregulation. Individuals with elevated emotion dysregulation are more likely to report eating pathology, but not other outcomes, when experiencing increased ‘feeling fat’. In contrast, ‘feeling fat’ underlies the relationship between COVID-19-related distress and transdiagnostic psychological outcomes, meaning ‘feeling fat’ should be considered a risk for psychopathology beyond eating disorders.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
AEGIS: a robust and scalable real-time public health surveillance system.,"In this report, we describe the Automated Epidemiological Geotemporal Integrated Surveillance system (AEGIS), developed for real-time population health monitoring in the state of Massachusetts. AEGIS provides public health personnel with automated near-real-time situational awareness of utilization patterns at participating healthcare institutions, supporting surveillance of bioterrorism and naturally occurring outbreaks. As real-time public health surveillance systems become integrated into regional and national surveillance initiatives, the challenges of scalability, robustness, and data security become increasingly prominent. A modular and fault tolerant design helps AEGIS achieve scalability and robustness, while a distributed storage model with local autonomy helps to minimize risk of unauthorized disclosure. The report includes a description of the evolution of the design over time in response to the challenges of a regional and national integration environment.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
MO521 OUTCOME OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE PATIENTS WITH SARS COV-2 INFECTION- A SINGLE CENTRE EXPERIENCE,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Since the outbreak of COVID 19 there have been 88.1 million confirmed cases and 1,9 million deaths in 218 countries, while in Serbia we have had 39.867 cases of COVID 19 and 3479 deaths with approximate death rate of 1%. Fatality rate worldwide vary widely, from 0% in Singapore to 8,8% in Mexico with the average value of 3%. Although there are many published studies about COVID 19, influence of chronic kidney disease and chronic dialysis on outcome of patients with the coronavirus infection is still not clear. The aim of this study was to explore whether the presence of CKD including ESRD and chronic dialysis treatment increases COVID 19 patients’ risk for adverse clinical outcome. METHOD: This retrospective study included 88 patients who were hospitalized at the Nephrology department in Zvezdara University Clinical Center which was transformed into a COVID hospital at the time. These patients were treated from 01.04.2020. to 01.06.2020. and 37 (42%) of them had CKD, while 51 (58%) had no signs of kidney disease. We analysed data collection from the patients’ history, including age, sex, comorbidities, symptoms, blood and radiology findings, therapy and outcome. We compared outcome (fatal and need for mechanical ventilation) between CKD and non CKD group and also analized dialysis as a risk factor for adverse outcome. Statistical analysis has been performed using SPSS software version 20 and OR was calculated using Logistic Regression. RESULTS: We analysed 88 patients, a mean age of 62+15 years, 59.1% males. Out of 88 patients, 37 had CKD, while 27 of them were on hemodialysis and 2 on peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). At the end of follow-up, 46 patients (52.3%) was discharged home, 27 (30.7%) was transferred to another hospital and 14 (15.9%) died. Regarding influence of CKD on COVID-19 patients’ outcome it was shown that patients with CKD had 3-fold higher chances for discharge than for the fatal outcome (p=0.05) and 4-fold less risk for use of the mechanical ventilation (ns) as compared to non CKD patients. We also found that ESRD and chronic dialysis affect outcome with statistical significance (p=0.01) in a way that it doubles the risk for the adverse outcome. CONCLUSION: Patients with CKD, especially those with ESRD had significantly higher risk for the lethal outcome and higher chances to require the mechanical ventilation.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
The role of STEMI integrated networking system based on tele-cardiology for reducing ischemic time and crossing wire time delayed during COVID 19 pandemic,"Background : During a public health emergency, such as outbreak of COVID-19, delayed for reperfusion become even more challenging to predict. Telecardiology has the advantage of reducing STEMI patient's access time to the emergency units and reduces the delayed for reperfusion. Purpose: Evaluate the impact of this program on pre-hospital and in-hospital (door-to-balloon) delays in STEMI patients admitted to a Tertiary Healthcare Center in Indonesia who performed Primary PCI between Pre Covid-19 and Covid-19 Era Method : This is a retrospective, observational study that included all patients, 18 to 90 years of age, who presented with STEMI via ACS prehospital network or through the Accident and Emergency department of a General Hospital. They were classified in four groups according to the method of admission: conventional emergency department group pre COVID-19 era (Group A), ACS prehospital network-group pre COVID- 19 era (Group B), Conventional emergency department group in the COVID-19 era (Group C), and ACS prehospital network-group in COVID-19 era (Group D). We selected a time frame of 1 month after declaration of COVID-19 infection as a “Pandemic” (ie, March 1 until December 31th 2020;COVID-19 era group).A group of STEMI patients from a similar time period of last year (ie, March 1 until December 31th 2019;pre-COVID-19 era group) was used as control. Outcomes of interest were number of patients referred for reperfusion, distribution of total ischemic time of patients referred in the network and door to crossing wire time. Results : A total of 184 patients were included in this study (123 Pre-COVID-19 and 61 during the COVID-19 Pandemic) according to the method of admission: Group A, 27 patients, Group B, 96 patients, Group C 25 patients, and Group D 36 patients. We found significant 42% drop in the number of STEMI patients treated by PPCI in this general hospital during pandemic era. Group B had the lowest mean of total ischemic time compare than group A, D, and C (217.34 ± 116 minute, 285 ± 165 minute, 432 ± 204 minute, 609 ± 246 minute, Respectively, P = 0.000. Group B had the lowest mean of crossing wire time compare than group A, D, and C (82 ± 10.9 minute, 96.4 ± 48 minute, 175 ± 41 minute, 132 ± 38 minute, Respectively, P = 0.000. The proportion of ischemic time delay > 720 minutes was more higher in Group C than Group D (36% vs 13.9%, P = 0.045, respectively). The proportion of crossing wire time > 140 minutes was more higher in Group C than group D (76% vs 27.8%, respectively, P = 0.000). The proportion of inhospital mortality was more higher in group C compare than group D ( 32% vs 11.1%, respectively, P = 0.045). Conclusion : Our STEMI networking based on tele-cardiology system reduce the ischemic time delayed, Crossing wire time delayed and Inhospital mortality during pandemic COVID-19 era.

A review on the COVID-19-related psychological impact on older adults: vulnerable or not?,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a novel event of the twenty-first century. Therefore, contemporary research is required to determine the current pandemic’s psychological impact on older populations. Soon after the COVID-19 outbreak, several narrative reviews and guidelines were released to support older adult’s psychological wellbeing. However, a lack of data from original studies was reported until May 2020. AIM: To identify studies published from May 2020 until January 2021 that quantitatively assessed the mental health impact of COVID-19 on older adults using validated psychometric tools. METHOD: A comprehensive literature search of original research articles was conducted using specific terms. The screening procedure was conducted stepwise. RESULTS: Among the 18 included studies, cross-sectional online surveys indicated that older adults were less psychologically distressed than younger ones. A longitudinal study revealed that COVID-19 did not have a major impact on loneliness and satisfaction with life. On the contrary, studies comparing pre- with peri-pandemic data revealed that older adults experienced more severe depressive/anxiety/stress symptoms and loneliness during the pandemic. Several studies reported though only subclinical symptoms, as well as low loneliness levels during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Research studies suggested that older age may buffer against the COVID-19-related impact on mental health. Despite evidence against generalised perceptions of vulnerability, older adults’ ability to adapt to adversity may be uneven, depending on cultural, social, economic and other individual factors. Taken together, the impact, moreover the long-term impact of COVID-19, is expected to vary across countries and older subpopulations, and remains to be evaluated by prospective, longitudinal studies.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

A survey of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in COVID-19 patients,"Background and Aims: The novel coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has placed severe resource constraints on hospitals. High mortality rates of the COVID-19 have overwhelmed the resuscitation services. The constant fear of virus infection during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has placed severe restrictions on the resuscitation services. Reports of poor outcomes after CPR further dampened the spirits of CPR providers. Hence we surveyed CPR practices for COVID-19 patients across hospitals in India by health care providers. Material and Methods: An online survey using Google Forms was initiated to collect data on performance of CPR in diagnosed cases of COVID-19 after in-hospital cardiac arrest. The survey's web-link was publicized using social media, and participation sought of all personnel involved in CPR delivery in COVID-19 patients. The responses received were analyzed. The main outcome measured were determination of the percentage of COVID-19 patients discharged home who were administered CPR. Results: There were 248 responses from different parts of India. At the time of cardiac arrest, 194 victims had diffuse lung infiltrates, 22 had mild lung disease, while 32 had no documented lung lesion. Twenty-five victims had evidence of pulmonary embolism, 39 had cardiac involvement, and 3 had brain involvement. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved in 59.27% of cases but ROSC sustained in only 22.59%. 7.25% of patients, who received CPR, could be discharged home. Conclusion: The survey has shown reasonable survival rates after CPR administration in COVID-19 patients suffering from IHCA. We should not ignore the need to maximize live outcomes after CPR, even in COVID-19 patients. © 2021 Journal of Anaesthesiology Clinical Pharmacology Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Acute Hemorrhagic Encephalitis Related to COVID-19.,"Purpose of Review The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the most critical public health challenge in recent history. In this report, we present a case of suspected acute hemorrhagic encephalitis with bilateral intracranial hemorrhages associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Recent Findings A 48-year-old female COVID-19-positive patient developed acute changes in her neurologic status. A head CT with CT angiography demonstrated extensive bilateral parietal and occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension and acute hydrocephalus. The patient was treated with an external ventricular drain, and a CSF sample was tested for SARS-CoV-2 but was found to be negative. Summary The underlying mechanism for developing acute hemorrhagic encephalitis in viral illnesses may be autoimmune in nature and warrants further investigation. The initial neurologic presentation of COVID-19-related hemorrhagic encephalitis is altered level of consciousness, which may prompt further neurologic examination and imaging to exclude this feature.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Consensus Report on Destination Therapy in Japanã- From the DT Committee of the Council for Clinical Use of Ventricular Assist Device Related Academic Societies,"Destination therapy (DT) is the indication to implant a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in a patient with stage D heart failure who is not a candidate for heart transplantation. The implantable LVAD has been utilized in Japan since 2011 under the indication of bridge to transplant (BTT). After almost 10 year lag, DT has finally been approved and reimbursed in May 2021 in Japan. To initiate the DT program in Japan, revision of the LVAD indication from BTT is necessary. Also, in-depth discussion of caregiver issues as well as end-of-life care is indispensable. For that purpose, we assembled a DT committee of multidisciplinary members in August 2020, and started monthly discussions via web-based communication during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a summary of the consensus reached after 6 months' discussion, and we have included as many relevant topics as possible. Clinical application of DT has just started, and we are willing to revise this consensus to meet the forthcoming issues raised during real-world clinical experience.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Transplant Administration- A Survey of the Roles and Responsibilities of Kidney and Pancreas Medical Directors of U.S Transplant Centers.,"The current American Society of Transplantation (AST) accredited transplant fellowship programs in the U.S. provide no structured formal training in leadership and administration which is essential for successfully running a transplant program. We conducted a survey of medical directors of active adult kidney and kidney-pancreas transplant programs in U.S. about their demographics, training pathways, and roles and responsibilities. The survey was emailed to 183 medical directors, and 123 (67.2%) completed the survey. A majority of respondents were older than 50 years (61%), males (80%) and holding that position for more than 10 years (47%). Only 51% of current medical directors had taken that position after completing a one-year transplant fellowship and 58% took on the role with no prior administrative or leadership experience. The medical directors reported spending a median 50-75% of time in clinical responsibilities, 25-50% of time in administration and 0-25% time in research. The survey also captured various administrative roles of medical directors vis-à-vis other transplant leaders. The study, Clinical Transplantation for Review Only designed to be the starting point of an improvement initiative of the AST, provided important insight into the demographics, training pathways, roles and responsibilities, job satisfaction, education needs, and training gaps of current medical directors.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Acquisition of multidrug-resistant Enterobacterales during international travel: a systematic review of clinical and microbiological characteristics and meta-analyses of risk factors,"BACKGROUND: International tourism increased from 25 million tourist arrivals in 1950 to over 1.3 billion in 2017. These travelers can be exposed to (multi) resistant microorganisms, may become colonized, and bring them back home. This systematic review aims to identify the carriage rates of multidrug-resistant Enterobacterales (MDR-E) among returning travelers, to identify microbiological methods used, and to identify the leading risk factors for acquiring MDR-E during international travel. METHODS: Articles related to our research question were identified through a literature search in multiple databases (until June 18, 2019) - Embase, Medline Ovid, Cochrane, Scopus, Cinahl, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. RESULTS: Out of 3211 potentially relevant articles, we included 22 studies in the systematic review, and 12 studies in 7 random-effects meta-analyses. Highest carriage rates of MDR-E were observed after travel to Southern Asia (median 71%), followed by travel to Northern Africa (median 42%). Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) were identified in 5 out of 22 studies, from a few patients. However, in only eight out of 22 studies (36.4%) the initial laboratory method targeted detection of the presence of CPE in the original samples. The risk factor with the highest pooled odds ratio (OR) for MDR-E was travel to Southern Asia (pooled OR = 14.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.50 to 36.45), followed by antibiotic use during travel (pooled OR = 2.78, 95% CI = 1.76 to 4.39). CONCLUSIONS: Risk of acquiring MDR-E while travelling increases depending on travel destination and if antibiotics are used during travel. This information is useful for the development of guidelines for healthcare facilities with low MDR-E prevalence rates to prevent admission of carriers without appropriate measures. The impact of such guidelines should be assessed.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease with high prevalence and substantial associated economical burden. A significant determinant of quality of life, long-term survival, and health care costs is an acute exacerbation of COPD. Acute exacerbations are provoked by respiratory viruses, altered airway microbiome, and environmental factors. The current treatment options are limited. In order to develop specific therapeutic measures, it is important to understand how acute exacerbations evolve. This review focuses on pathophysiology of stable and exacerbated COPD.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
The impact of COVID-19 on subthreshold depressive symptoms: a longitudinal study,"AIMS: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represents an unprecedented threat to mental health. Herein, we assessed the impact of COVID-19 on subthreshold depressive symptoms and identified potential mitigating factors. METHODS: Participants were from Depression Cohort in China (ChiCTR registry number 1900022145). Adults (n = 1722) with subthreshold depressive symptoms were enrolled between March and October 2019 in a 6-month, community-based interventional study that aimed to prevent clinical depression using psychoeducation. A total of 1506 participants completed the study in Shenzhen, China: 726 participants, who completed the study between March 2019 and January 2020 (i.e. before COVID-19), comprised the 'wave 1' group; 780 participants, who were enrolled before COVID-19 and completed the 6-month endpoint assessment during COVID-19, comprised 'wave 2'. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia were assessed at baseline and endpoint (i.e. 6-month follow-up) using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), respectively. Measures of resilience and regular exercise were assessed at baseline. We compared the mental health outcomes between wave 1 and wave 2 groups. We additionally investigated how mental health outcomes changed across disparate stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, i.e. peak (7-13 February), post-peak (14-27 February), remission plateau (28 February-present). RESULTS: COVID-19 increased the risk for three mental outcomes: (1) depression (odds ratio [OR] = 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-1.62); (2) anxiety (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.16-1.88) and (3) insomnia (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.07-1.77). The highest proportion of probable depression and anxiety was observed post-peak, with 52.9% and 41.4%, respectively. Greater baseline resilience scores had a protective effect on the three main outcomes (depression: OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.19-0.37; anxiety: OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.14-0.33 and insomnia: OR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.11-0.28). Furthermore, regular physical activity mitigated the risk for depression (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.79-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic exerted a highly significant and negative impact on symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia. Mental health outcomes fluctuated as a function of the duration of the pandemic and were alleviated to some extent with the observed decline in community-based transmission. Augmenting resiliency and regular exercise provide an opportunity to mitigate the risk for mental health symptoms during this severe public health crisis.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
CalScope: Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence from Vaccination and Prior Infection in Adults and Children in California May 2021– July 2021,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from vaccination and/or prior infection is critical to the public health response to the pandemic. CalScope is a population-based serosurvey in 7 counties in California. METHODS: We invited 200,000 randomly sampled households to enroll up to 1 adult and 1 child between April 20, 2021 and June 16, 2021. We tested all specimen for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike proteins, and each participant completed an online survey. We classified participants into categories: seronegative, antibodies from infection only, antibodies from infection and vaccination, and antibodies from vaccination only. RESULTS: 11,161 households enrolled (5.6%), with 7,483 adults and 1,375 children completing antibody testing. As of June 2021, 33% (95%CI [28%, 37%]) of adults and 57% (95%CI[48%, 66%]) of children were seronegative; 18% (95%CI[14%, 22%]) of adults and 26% (95%CI[19%, 32%]) of children had antibodies from infection alone; 9% (95%CI[6%,11%]) of adults and 5% (95%CI[1%, 8%]) of children had antibodies from infection and vaccination; and 41% (95%CI[37%, 45%]) of adults and 13% (95%CI [7%, 18%]) of children had antibodies from vaccination alone. CONCLUSIONS: As of June 2021, a third of adults and most children in California were seronegative. Serostatus varied regionally and by demographic group.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
The realities of rationing in health care,"Rationing of scarce health-care resources is distressing. Clinicians therefore require clear guidance, which should be developed systematically and transparently through multi-stakeholder engagement. Rationing is seldom required in high-income settings but is often necessary in low-income settings. Global solidarity and health system strengthening are required to reduce the need for rationing.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
The future of internationalization of higher education in challenging global contexts,"Internationalization has been over the past three decades one of the key focus points of (inter)national and institutional policies for higher education, with two related components: internationalization abroad, and internationalization at home. The 'abroad' component: mobility of students, faculty and programs, has been more predominant than the 'at home' component: internationalization of the curriculum and learning outcomes, perceived as a neoliberal and western paradigm. What will be the future of internationalization? Do we see a return from competition to cooperation? What will be the impact of the changing global economic, ecological and political context? These questions will be addressed in a critical analytical way in this paper, taking into account the impact of Covid-19 on the internationalization of higher education.Alternate abstract: A internacionalização tem sido, nas últimas três décadas, um dos principais focos das políticas (inter) nacionais e institucionais para o ensino superior, com dois componentes relacionados: internacionalização no exterior e internacionalização no país.

"Successful patient education on COVID-19 vaccine safety in a large rheumatology cohort using interactive mobile-phone video technology: context, results, and next steps","Background: There are reported concerns of patient misunderstanding of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination safety. It is particularly important that these are understood in patients taking complex immunusuppressive therapies. Rapid delivery of targeted and up-to-date video messages from clinicians sent directly to patients could address patient uncertainty, and improve COVID-19 vaccination uptake. Innovative SMS (short message service) based video message has already shown promise in delivering COVID-19 information to patients [1]. We present our experience in creating a tailored vaccine information video sent directly to our large cohort of patients in the UK with a range of rheumatic diseases and report on the learning points going forward. Objectives: Our three objectives were: (1) educate our patients using an interactive mobile video information resource outlining the safety of the COVID vaccination in these patient groups;(2) better understand our patients' views of the COVID-19 vaccine;(3) evaluate the patient experience of this approach. Methods: We designed and recorded an 8-minute interactive web-based video delivered education resource designed for mobile phones. This included: aims of the video;details of licenced vaccines;UK vaccination schedule;frequently asked questions;links to national charity resources;our clinician recommendations;a rheumatologist being vaccinated;case studies;and summary data. We produced a simple mobile phone web-based evaluation of the resource, including anonymised patient demographics, their understanding of the safety of the vaccine pre/ post video, and their user experience. Resource and evaluation were piloted by local healthcare professionals, our Patient Participation Group, a national charity, and approved by senior management. We distributed this to our follow-up patient cohort via our hospital SMS provider on 21.12.20, at the start of roll-out of UK vaccines, containing a link to the resource and evaluation. Results: Of a cohort of 10,981 patients, we had 8886 mobile phone numbers. At Day 14, we recorded 2358 video views (26.3%) and 664/2358 completed evaluations (28.1%). Only one person reported being unable to watch the video. Before watching the video, 348/664 patients (52.4%) were unsure if the vaccine was safe and/or recommended for them, rising to 626/664 (94.3%) post-video. Reasons for uncertainty after the video (38/664) included drug allergy and fertility concerns. Following the video, 509/664 patients (76.6%) reported that they were more likely to have the vaccination. The majority of the patients (614/660, 93.0%) agreed that the method was a helpful method to share such information.Age distribution of our whole cohort, patients with mobile phones, and responders were similar: Age >50 was 80.4%,76.3%,and 88.6% respectively. A large proportion was treated with immunosuppressive medication (61.3% conventional DMARD, 39.4% biological DMARD and 17.6% corticosteroids). Gender and case mix for responders were similar to published data from our cohort: female 74.0%;rheumatoid arthritis commonest disease (389/664, 58.5%). Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show the potential for SMS linked interactive multimedia message for patient education. The multimedia component allows users to easily navigate to relevant sections, and access a choice of linked resources. We demonstrate this low-cost technology is simple, effective and well placed to assist physicians in educating patients during a time when face-to-face contact is proving to be difficult. We have shown high levels of patient satisfaction, reassurance, and self-reported behaviour change. Such technology has potential utility for national bodies, primary and secondary care groups, and merits further research.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Long-term Changes of Disinfection Byproducts in Treatment of Simulated Ballast Water,"This study investigated the changes in concentrations of haloacetic acids (HAAs) and haloacetonitriles (HANs) as disinfection byproducts (DBPs) for different storage times (as long as 20 days) and temperatures (5 to 20°C). A ship’s voyage after treatment of its ballast water with active substances was considered. The HAA showed a clear trend of increasing concentration only with storage time, especially for dibromoacetic acid (DBAA). Dissolved organic nitrogen concentration was increased by the decomposition of dead organisms at 10 days, and then reacted with the remaining total residual oxidants, resulting in increased concentration of DBPs. An environmental risk assessment indicated that DBAN and monochloroacetic acid (MCAA) could have a negative impact on the marine environment. This study suggests that, because all international vessels must have a ballast water management system installed by September, 2024, the conc e ntra tio ns of DBPs, especially DBAN, MCAA, and DBAA, should be monitored in the waters at major international ports.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Bacteria–autophagy interplay: a battle for survival,"Autophagy is a cellular process that targets proteins, lipids and organelles to lysosomes for degradation, but it has also been shown to combat infection with various pathogenic bacteria. In turn, bacteria have developed diverse strategies to avoid autophagy by interfering with autophagy signalling or the autophagy machinery and, in some cases, they even exploit autophagy for their growth. In this Review, we discuss canonical and non-canonical autophagy pathways and our current knowledge of antibacterial autophagy, with a focus on the interplay between bacterial factors and autophagy components.

"How has COVID-19 social distancing impacted physical activity patterns? Data from the PAMPA cohort, Brazil","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate how social distancing measures affected physical activity (PA) patterns in adults from Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. METHODS: Participants were recruited from social and local media campaigns, contacts with private and public universities, as well as research personal contacts across the state. PA was assessed before (retrospectively) and during social distancing. Frequency (days per week) and time (minutes per day) were asked to those participants who practiced PA. Two PA variables were built to each time-frame (before and during social distancing): 1) any PA (yes/no question), and 2) sufficient PA (based on the 150 min/week cut-off point). RESULTS: Overall, 2321 participants answered the questionnaire. Any and sufficient PA decreased from before to during social distancing (22.3% and 17.0%, respectively). A linear increase of activity during social distancing was observed in participants who practiced up to 400 min or less of PA per week before social distancing. Regarding associated factors, female, overweight/obese and diagnosed chronic disease participants were less likely to practice any or sufficient PA during social distancing when compared to the period before. CONCLUSION: PA practice (both any and sufficient) decreased in Southern Brazil in the first months of social distancing. Women, overweight/obese and chronic diseased participants showed a higher decrease in PA compared to other groups. Finally, those participants who practiced PA before social distancing were more likely to continue practicing during COVID-19 pandemic.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Epidemiological analysis of asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019-infected individuals in the community based on an individual-based model,"Background: Asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-infected individuals (AIIs) is a special group that differs from COVID-19 patients. This will provide us with a deeper understanding on the impact of AIIs on the epidemic and a theoretical basis to establish more precise prevention and control measures to control this disease. Methods: : We established an individual-based computer model to simulate the occurrence, infection, discovery, quarantine, and quarantine release (recovery) of AIIs or patients within the community. The model was used to explore the effects of measures such as active tracing, laboratory testing, active treatment, and home quarantine on the epidemic. Results: : Given the condition that R 0 =1.2, when a case of imported AII was reported in the community, the implementation of measures reduced the number of AIIs and patients by 62.2% and 62.4%, respectively. The number of undetected AIIs and patients peaked at 302 d of the epidemic, reaching 53 and 20 individuals, respectively. Conclusion: The implementation of sustained active tracing, laboratory testing, active treatment, and home quarantine can significantly reduce probability of disease outbreak and block the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic caused by asymptomatic infected individuals in the community.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Characteristics and factors associated with mortality of 200 COVID-19 patients at a Philippine COVID-19 tertiary referral center,"Objectives. To describe the clinical profile and factors associated with mortality among the first 200 patients confirmed to have COVID-19 infection admitted in the University of the Philippines – Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH). Methodology. We conducted a review of adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to the UP-PGH, a designated COVID-19 referral center. Demographic, clinical data and clinical outcomes were extracted from medical records. Frequencies and distributions of various clinical characteristics were described, and factors associated with mortality were investigated. Results. Of the 200 patients in our cohort, most were male (55.5%), and the median age was 56 years old. Underlying comorbid illnesses were present in 67.5% of patients, which included hypertension (49.5%), diabetes mellitus (26.5%), and other cardiovascular diseases (20.5%). The most frequent presenting symptoms were cough (69.0%), fever (58.5%), or shortness of breath (53.0%). Most patients presented with mild (n=41, 20.5%) to moderate illness (n=99, 49.5%) and only 60 were considered severely (n=32, 16.0%) or critically ill (n=28, 14.0%). Many (61%) received empiric antibiotics, while 44.5% received either repurposed drugs or investigational therapies for COVID-19. Bacterial co-infection was documented in 11%, with Klebsiella pneumoniae commonly isolated. In-hospital mortality was 17.5%, which was highest for critical COVID-19 (71.4%). Mortality was observed to be higher among patients aged 60 and above, requiring oxygen, ventilatory support, and ICU admission, and those who developed acute kidney injury, acute stroke, sepsis, and nosocomial pneumonia. Conclusion. Our study confirmed that COVID-19 affects older individuals and those with underlying comorbid conditions. Empiric antimicrobial treatment was given for most patients, despite documentation of bacterial infection in only 11%. K. pneumoniae was commonly isolated, reflecting local epidemiology. The mortality rate during this early period of the pandemic was high and comparable with other institutions. Factors associated with mortality were related to critical COVID-19 and were similar to other studies. © 2021 University of the Philippines Manila.

TLR3 controls constitutive IFN-β antiviral immunity in human fibroblasts and cortical neurons.,"Human herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis can be caused by inborn errors of the TLR3 pathway, resulting in impairment of CNS cell-intrinsic antiviral immunity. Deficiencies of the TLR3 pathway impair cell-intrinsic immunity to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and HSV-1 in fibroblasts, and to HSV-1 in cortical but not trigeminal neurons. The underlying molecular mechanism is thought to involve impaired IFN-α/β induction by the TLR3 recognition of dsRNA viral intermediates or by-products. However, we show here that human TLR3 controls constitutive levels of IFNB mRNA and secreted bioactive IFN-β protein, and thereby also controls constitutive mRNA levels for IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in fibroblasts. Tlr3-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts also have lower basal ISG levels. Moreover, human TLR3 controls basal levels of IFN-β secretion and ISG mRNA in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons. Consistently, TLR3-deficient human fibroblasts and cortical neurons are vulnerable not only to both VSV and HSV-1, but also to several other families of viruses. The mechanism by which TLR3 restricts viral growth in human fibroblasts and cortical neurons in vitro and, by inference, by which the human CNS prevents infection by HSV-1 in vivo, is therefore based on the control of early viral infection by basal IFN-β immunity.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Progression of SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in St. Louis, Missouri, through January 2021","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seropositivity was assessed for 3,066 individuals visiting hospitals in St. Louis, Missouri, during July 2020, November 2020, or January 2021. Seropositivity in children increased from 5.22% in July to 21.16% in January. In the same time frame, seropositivity among adults increased from 4.52% to 19.03%, prior to initiation of mass vaccination. IMPORTANCE This study determined the percentage of children and adult samples from the St. Louis metropolitan area in Missouri with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during three collection periods spanning July 2020 to January 2021. By January 2021, 20.68% of the tested individuals had antibodies. These results show the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in St. Louis, Missouri, and provide a snapshot of the extent of infection just prior to the start of mass vaccination.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Association of HLA Class I Genotypes With Severity of Coronavirus Disease-19,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules play a crucial role in the development of a specific immune response to viral infections by presenting viral peptides at the cell surface where they will be further recognized by T cells. In the present manuscript, we explored whether HLA class I genotypes can be associated with the critical course of Coronavirus Disease-19 by searching possible connections between genotypes of deceased patients and their age at death. HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C genotypes of n = 111 deceased patients with COVID-19 (Moscow, Russia) and n = 428 volunteers were identified with next-generation sequencing. Deceased patients were split into two groups according to age at the time of death: n = 26 adult patients aged below 60 and n = 85 elderly patients over 60. With the use of HLA class I genotypes, we developed a risk score (RS) which was associated with the ability to present severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) peptides by the HLA class I molecule set of an individual. The resulting RS was significantly higher in the group of deceased adults compared to elderly adults [p = 0.00348, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC = 0.68)]. In particular, presence of HLA-A*01:01 allele was associated with high risk, while HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*03:01 mainly contributed to low risk. The analysis of patients with homozygosity strongly highlighted these results: homozygosity by HLA-A*01:01 accompanied early deaths, while only one HLA-A*02:01 homozygote died before 60 years of age. Application of the constructed RS model to an independent Spanish patients cohort (n = 45) revealed that the score was also associated with the severity of the disease. The obtained results suggest the important role of HLA class I peptide presentation in the development of a specific immune response to COVID-19.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Teaching soldiers French: How motivation affects their success,"The paper deals with problematic of teaching adults a second foreign language. The article has focused on the groups of young soldiers who attended French courses for a period of two to four weeks during the fall semester of 2020 in the COVID pandemic situation. The main objective of the paper is to help teachers better plan teaching for specific groups of students. In this paper, the motivation of course participants have been examined. The paper suggests that the intrinsic motivation of the students allows participants to learn the language better. It has been observed that neither previous education in French nor career development is significant for student success. The findings suggest that students who were intrinsically motivated before the start of the course (for personal or professional reasons) tended to work more in their free time;and therefore, they mastered French sooner. The findings helped the researchers gain a better understanding of student failure and helped them in the adaptation of offered courses. The paper could be useful for anyone teaching adults a second language. Copyright © 2021. Marie KALA and Magdalena VESELA.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

"Political regime, data transparency, and COVID-19 death cases","The COVID-19—the worst pandemic since the Spanish flu—has dramatically changed the world, with a significant number of people suffering from and dying of the disease. Some scholars argue that democratic governments are disadvantaged in coping with the current pandemic mainly because they cannot intervene in their citizens' lives as aggressively as their authoritarian counterparts. Other scholars, however, suggest that possible data manipulation may account for the apparent advantage of authoritarian countries. Taking such a possibility seriously, this paper analyzes the relationship between political regimes, data transparency, and COVID-19 deaths using cross-national data for over 108 countries, obtained from Worldometer COVID-19 Data, Polity V Project, Variety of Democracy (V-Dem) Project, HRV Transparency Project among other sources. Regression analyses indicate that authoritarian countries do not necessarily tend to have fewer COVID-19 deaths than their democratic counterparts after controlling for other factors, especially data transparency. The transparency variable itself, on the other hand, is positively correlated with the number of death cases more consistently (P &lt;0.05). Overall, the estimation results point to the possible data manipulation, not the nature of regime characteristics itself, as a more significant source for the seemingly low casualty rates in authoritarian countries.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Rice endosperm is cost‐effective for the production of recombinant griffithsin with potent activity against HIV,"Protein microbicides containing neutralizing antibodies and antiviral lectins may help to reduce the rate of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) if it is possible to manufacture the components in large quantities at a cost affordable in HIV‐endemic regions such as sub‐Saharan Africa. We expressed the antiviral lectin griffithsin (GRFT), which shows potent neutralizing activity against HIV, in the endosperm of transgenic rice plants (Oryza sativa), to determine whether rice can be used to produce inexpensive GRFT as a microbicide ingredient. The yield of (OS)GRFT in the best‐performing plants was 223 μg/g dry seed weight. We also established a one‐step purification protocol, achieving a recovery of 74% and a purity of 80%, which potentially could be developed into a larger‐scale process to facilitate inexpensive downstream processing. (OS)GRFT bound to HIV glycans with similar efficiency to GRFT produced in Escherichia coli. Whole‐cell assays using purified (OS)GRFT and infectivity assays using crude extracts of transgenic rice endosperm confirmed that both crude and pure (OS)GRFT showed potent activity against HIV and the crude extracts were not toxic towards human cell lines, suggesting they could be administered as a microbicide with only minimal processing. A freedom‐to‐operate analysis confirmed that GRFT produced in rice is suitable for commercial development, and an economic evaluation suggested that 1.8 kg/ha of pure GRFT could be produced from rice seeds. Our data therefore indicate that rice could be developed as an inexpensive production platform for GRFT as a microbicide component.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Evaluation of Bivalirudin as the Primary Anticoagulant in Patients Receiving Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for SARS-CoV-2-Associated Acute Respiratory Failure.,"BACKGROUND Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a potential option for the management of severe acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. Conflicting the use of this therapy is the known coagulopathy within COVID-19, leading to an incidence of venous thrombotic events of 25% to 49%. To date, limited guidance is available on optimal anticoagulation strategies in this population. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utilization of a pharmacist-driven bivalirudin dosing protocol for anticoagulation in the setting of ECMO for COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. METHODS This was a single-center retrospective chart review over a 9-month period of patients receiving bivalirudin while on ECMO. All patients with acute respiratory failure requiring ECMO with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction were included. Bivalirudin was dosed via aPTT monitoring after a starting dose of 0.2 or 0.3 mg/kg/h. RESULTS There were 33 patients included in this study, all receiving mechanical ventilation. The most common starting dose of bivalirudin was 0.2 mg/kg/h, with an average time to therapeutic range of 20 hours. Compared to previous reports, rates of bleeding were low at 15.1%, and 6.1% of patients developed a new venous thromboembolic event while on ECMO. ECMO survival was 51.5%, with an ICU mortality rate of 48.5%. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE In the first published report of its use within this population, bivalirudin was found to be a viable choice for anticoagulation in those patients on ECMO for severe respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
The Focused Neurosurgical Examination During Telehealth Visits: Guidelines During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond,"OBJECTIVE: To provide guidelines to healthcare workers for performing a focused neurological examination via telemedicine during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-2019) pandemic. METHODS: We reviewed our department's outpatient clinic visits after the implementation of a telemedicine protocol in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Crossover rates from telehealth to in-person visits were evaluated and guidelines for performing a telemedicine neurological exam were created based on the consensus of 16 neurosurgical attending providers over a four-month period. RESULTS: From March 23, 2020 to July 20, 2020, some 2157 telehealth visits were performed in our department. Some 26 were converted to in-person visits by the provider request with the most cited reason for conversion being the need for a more detailed patient evaluation. Based on these experiences, we created a graphical tutorial to address the key components of the neurological exam with adaptations specific to the telehealth visit. CONCLUSIONS: In response to the global coronavirus pandemic, telemedicine has become an integral part of neurosurgeons' daily practice. Telemedicine failures remain low but primarily occur due to a need for more comprehensive evaluations. We provide guidelines for the neurosurgical exam during telehealth visits in an effort to assuage some of these issues.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Influence of COVID-19 Building Restrictions on Physical Activity Promotion Through Increased Stair Use and Limited Elevator Access: A Quasi-Experimental Study-Sport and Physical Activity Group Active Campus Project,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of UK government COVID-19 safe offices policy to increase stair use in a higher education setting during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Automated counts at 3 ground floor staircases and the elevator entrances were used to estimate stair to elevator use ratio for ascent and descent from/to the ground floor of a university building at baseline (January to March 2020), first and second intervention months (October 2020, November 2020, respectively). Stair promoting signage and a 1-way system was implemented, in line with government policy. RESULTS: At baseline, stair to elevator use ratio for ascent from and descent to the ground floor was 1.36 (0.02) and 1.88 (0.02) people, respectively. The ratio significantly increased in the first intervention month to 2.64 (0.09) and 3.96 (0.22) people for ascent and descent, respectively. However, the ratio decreased between the first and second intervention months to 1.63 (0.06) and 3.05 (0.52) people for ascent and descent, respectively. CONCLUSION: The UK government COVID-19 policy was effective at increasing stair use in a higher education setting.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Critical event debriefing: a checklist for the aftermath.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Millions of perioperative crises (e.g. anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest) may occur annually. Critical event debriefing can offer benefits to the individual, team, and system, yet only a fraction of perioperative critical events are debriefed in real-time. This publication aims to review evidence-based best practices for proximal critical event debriefing. RECENT FINDINGS Evidence-based key processes to consider for proximal critical event debriefing can be summarized by the WATER mnemonic: Welfare check (assessing team members' emotional and physical wellbeing to continue providing care); Acute/short-term corrections (matters to be addressed before the next case); Team reactions and reflections (summarizing case; listening to team member reactions; plus/delta conversation); Education (lessons learned from the event and debriefing); Resource awareness and longer term needs [follow-up (e.g. safety/quality improvement report), local peer-support and employee assistance resources]. A cognitive aid to accompany this mnemonic is provided with the publication. SUMMARY There is growing literature on how to conduct proximal perioperative critical event debriefing. Evidence-based best practices, as well as a cognitive aid to apply them, may help bridge the gap between theory and clinical practice. In this era of increased attention to burnout and wellness, the consideration of interventions to improve the quality and frequency of critical event debriefing is paramount.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Emerging role of exosomes in the pathology of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases; destructive and therapeutic properties,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is known as the third leading cause of human death globally. Enhanced chronic inflammation and pathological remodeling are the main consequences of COPD, leading to decreased life span. Histological and molecular investigations revealed that prominent immune cell infiltration and release of several cytokines contribute to progressive chronic remodeling. Recent investigations have revealed that exosomes belonging to extracellular vesicles are involved in the pathogenesis of COPD. It has been elucidated that exosomes secreted from immune cells are eligible to carry numerous pro-inflammatory factors exacerbating the pathological conditions. Here, in this review article, we have summarized various and reliable information about the negative role of immune cell-derived exosomes in the remodeling of pulmonary tissue and airways destruction in COPD patients.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Tissue distribution of a feline AGP related protein (fAGPrP) in cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)(),"Feline α(1)-acid glycoprotein (fAGP) increases during feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). We have recently identified a 29 kDa protein that we named feline AGP-related protein (fAGPrP) due to its cross-reactivity with an anti-human AGP monoclonal antibody. In this work we describe the tissue distribution of fAGPrP during FIP, and its relationship with feline coronavirus (FCoV) and myeloid cells. Tissues from five control cats and from 15 cats with FIP were examined by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies against human AGP, FCoV and myeloid antigens. Diffuse fAGPrP positivity within the lesions, likely due to vascular plasma leakage, endothelial and epithelial lining were detectable. Compared to controls, fAGPrP-expressing cells often increased in number and were diffusely distributed in lymph nodes, as usually occurs for IgM-producing plasma cells during early immune responses. These findings did not depend on the presence of FCoVs or of myeloid cells, suggesting that fAGPrP is not directly involved in the pathogenesis of FIP.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
At the height of the storm: Healthcare staff’s health conditions and job satisfaction and their associated predictors during the epidemic peak of COVID-19,"Abstract This study reports the physical health, mental health, anxiety, depression, distress, and job satisfaction of healthcare staff in Iran when the country faced its highest number of total active COVID-19 cases. In a sample of 304 healthcare staff (doctors, nurses, radiologists, technicians, etc.), we found a sizable portion reached the cutoff levels of disorders in anxiety (28.0%), depression (30.6%), and distress (20.1%). Age, gender, education, access to PPE (personal protective equipment), healthcare institutions (public vs. private), and individual status of COVID-19 infection each predicted some but not all the outcome variables of SF-12, PHQ-4, K6, and job satisfaction. The healthcare workers varied greatly in their access to PPE and in their status of COVID-19 infection: negative (69.7%), unsure (28.0%), and positive (2.3%). The predictors were also different from those identified in previous studies of healthcare staff during the COVID-19 crisis in China. This study helps to identify the healthcare staff in need to enable more targeted help as healthcare staff in many countries are facing peaks in their COVID-19 cases.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 induces fibrin(ogen) resistant to fibrinolysis: Implications for microclot formation in COVID-19,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) -induced infection, the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is characterized by unprecedented clinical pathologies. One of the most important pathologies, is hypercoagulation and microclots in the lungs of patients. Here we study the effect of isolated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit as potential inflammagen sui generis. Using scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy as well as mass spectrometry, we investigate the potential of this inflammagen to interact with platelets and fibrin(ogen) directly to cause blood hypercoagulation. Using platelet poor plasma (PPP), we show that spike protein may interfere with blood flow. Mass spectrometry also showed that when spike protein S1 is added to healthy PPP, it results in structural changes to {beta} and {gamma} fibrin(ogen), complement 3, and prothrombin. These proteins were substantially resistant to trypsinization, in the presence of spike protein S1. Here we suggest that, in part, the presence of spike protein in circulation may contribute to the hypercoagulation in COVID-19 positive patients and may cause substantial impairment of fibrinolysis. Such lytic impairment may result in the persistent large microclots we have noted here and previously in plasma samples of COVID-19 patients. This observation may have important clinical relevance in the treatment of hypercoagulability in COVID-19 patients.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Improved targeting of radio-frequency ablation probes and thermal sensors: a preliminary investigation of flat-panel CT-guided ablation of renal tumors performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory.,"Flat-panel detector CT (FD-CT) provides cross-sectional CT-images while offering an improved workspace using fluoroscopic guidance for thermal probe placement such as for radiofrequency ablation (RFA) needles and thermal sensors. The purpose of this article is to test the feasibility of FD-CT in the application of renal tumor ablation in a ""hybrid operating room"" environment. Eleven patients with renal masses diagnosed preprocedurally with contrast-enhanced CT scan underwent core biopsy and simultaneous CT-RFA under general anesthesia with FD-CT guidance in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Scans were taken preablation for tumor targeting, intermittently for probe placement and guidance of temperature sensors, and postablation. Perioperative and postoperative outcomes, pathologic results, and radiographic follow-up were recorded for each patient. Target temperatures >60°C to guide treatment end point were reached for each tumor periphery. Biopsy pathology showed 6/11 (55%) to be renal-cell carcinoma, and 2/11 (18%) to be benign; 3/11 (27%) had an indeterminate biopsy result. Three Clavien grade I complications occurred. One patient showed evidence of recurrent disease on postoperative CT scan. In our experience, we have found FD-CT-guided ablation of small renal tumors to be feasible using this advanced targeting system.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Characterization of the fusion core in zebrafish endogenous retroviral envelope protein,"Zebrafish endogenous retrovirus (ZFERV) is the unique endogenous retrovirus in zebrafish, as yet, containing intact open reading frames of its envelope protein gene in zebrafish genome. Similarly, several envelope proteins of endogenous retroviruses in human and other mammalian animal genomes (such as syncytin-1 and 2 in human, syncytin-A and B in mouse) were identified and shown to be functional in induction of cell–cell fusion involved in placental development. ZFERV envelope protein (Env) gene appears to be also functional in vivo because it is expressible. After sequence alignment, we found ZFERV Env shares similar structural profiles with syncytin and other type I viral envelopes, especially in the regions of N- and C-terminal heptad repeats (NHR and CHR) which were crucial for membrane fusion. We expressed the regions of N + C protein in the ZFERV Env (residues 459–567, including predicted NHR and CHR) to characterize the fusion core structure. We found N + C protein could form a stable coiled-coil trimer that consists of three helical NHR regions forming a central trimeric core, and three helical CHR regions packing into the grooves on the surface of the central core. The structural characterization of the fusion core revealed the possible mechanism of fusion mediated by ZFERV Env. These results gave comprehensive explanation of how the ancient virus infects the zebrafish and integrates into the genome million years ago, and showed a rational clue for discovery of physiological significance (e.g., medicate cell–cell fusion).",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Sensitivity and breadth of detection of high-throughput sequencing for adventitious virus detection,"High-throughput sequencing (HTS) is capable of broad virus detection encompassing both known and unknown adventitious viruses in a variety of sample matrices. We describe the development of a general-purpose HTS-based method for the detection of adventitious viruses. Performance was evaluated using 16 viruses equivalent to well-characterized National Institutes of Health (NIH) virus stocks and another six viruses of interest. A viral vaccine crude harvest and a cell substrate matrix were spiked with 22 viruses. Specificity was demonstrated for all 22 viruses at the species level. Our method was capable of detecting and identifying adventitious viruses spiked at 10(4) genome copies per milliliter in a viral vaccine crude harvest and 0.01 viral genome copies spiked per cell in a cell substrate matrix. Moreover, 9 of the 11 NIH model viruses with published in vivo data were detected by HTS with an equivalent or better sensitivity (in a viral vaccine crude harvest). Our general-purpose HTS method is unbiased and highly sensitive for the detection of adventitious viruses, and has a large breadth of detection, which may obviate the need to perform in vivo testing.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Antitussive noscapine and antiviral drug conjugates as arsenal against COVID-19: a comprehensive chemoinformatics analysis,"Coronavirus pandemic has caused a vast number of deaths worldwide. Thus creating an urgent need to develop effective counteragents against novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Many antiviral drugs have been repurposed for treatment but implicated minimal recovery, which further advanced the need for clearer insights and innovation to derive effective therapeutics. Strategically, Noscapine, an approved antitussive drug with positive effects on lung linings may show favorable outcomes synergistically with antiviral drugs in trials. Hence, we have theoretically examined the combinatorial drug therapy by culminating the existing experimental results with in silico analyses. We employed the antitussive noscapine in conjugation with antiviral drugs (Chloroquine, Umifenovir, Hydroxychloroquine, Favlplravir and Galidesivir). We found that Noscapine-Hydroxychloroquine (Nos-Hcq) conjugate has strong binding affinity for the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, which performs key biological function in virus infection and progression. Nos-Hcq was analyzed through molecular dynamics simulation. The MD simulation for 100 ns affirmed the stable binding of conjugation unprecedentedly through RMSD and radius of gyration plots along with critical reaction coordinate binding free energy profile. Also, dynamical residue cross-correlation map with principal component analysis depicted the stable binding of Nos-Hcq conjugate to Mpro domains with optimal secondary structure statistics of complex dynamics. Also, we reveal the drugs with stable binding to major domains of Mpro can significantly improve the work profile of reaction coordinates, drug accession and inhibitory regulation of Mpro. The designed combinatorial therapy paves way for further prioritized in vitro and in vivo investigations for drug with robust binding against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

SARS-CoV-2 universal screening upon adult hospital admission in Southern Israel,"As the prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increased in the local community, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) universal screening was initiated for all adult patients admitted through the emergency departments (EDs) at Soroka University Medical Centre. Of 8518 patients screened, 288 (3.38%) tested positive. One hundred and thirty-three (46%) positive cases were asymptomatic and would have been admitted without necessary precautions. Patients with symptoms that may be attributable to COVID-19 were significantly older and were admitted through the medical ED. Patients of Bedouin Arab ethnicity accounted for half of those who tested positive, which was double their prevalence in the general population. These findings indicate that universal SARS-CoV-2 screening on adult hospital admission is crucial in areas with a high prevalence of COVID-19.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Development of Selective Phosphatidylinositol 5-Phosphate 4-Kinase γ Inhibitors with a Non-ATP-competitive, Allosteric Binding Mode","[Image: see text] Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinases (PI5P4Ks) are emerging as attractive therapeutic targets in diseases, such as cancer, immunological disorders, and neurodegeneration, owing to their central role in regulating cell signaling pathways that are either dysfunctional or can be modulated to promote cell survival. Different modes of binding may enhance inhibitor selectivity and reduce off-target effects in cells. Here, we describe efforts to improve the physicochemical properties of the selective PI5P4Kγ inhibitor, NIH-12848 (1). These improvements enabled the demonstration that this chemotype engages PI5P4Kγ in intact cells and that compounds from this series do not inhibit PI5P4Kα or PI5P4Kβ. Furthermore, the first X-ray structure of PI5P4Kγ bound to an inhibitor has been determined with this chemotype, confirming an allosteric binding mode. An exemplar from this chemical series adopted two distinct modes of inhibition, including through binding to a putative lipid interaction site which is 18 Å from the ATP pocket.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Conventional and in silico approaches to select promising food-derived bioactive peptides: A review,"The interest for food-derived bioactive peptides, either from common or unconventional sources, has increased due to their potential therapeutic effect against a wide range of diseases.

Hence, bioinformatic approaches, which can not only help to predict the formation of bioactive peptides from any known protein source, but also to analyze the protein structure/function relationship, have gained a new meaning in this scientific field. Therefore, this review aims to provides an overview of conventional characterization methods and the most recent advances in the field of in silico approaches for predicting and screening promising food-derived bioactive peptides.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Envisioned strategy for an early intervention in virus-suspected patients through non-invasive piezo- and pyro-electric-based wearable sensors,"The intervention of virus-infected persons mainly relies on diagnostic methods, and accordingly COVID-19 is not an exception Thus, a major research direction in viral diagnosis is aligned towards biological- and biomedical-based approaches In contrast, there is plenty of scope in wearable devices towards early intervention and continuous health status monitoring Of particular interest, piezo- and pyro-electric wearable sensors can play a significant role by detecting physiological signals in the virus-affected patients Remotely monitoring physiological signals, such as temperature, respiration, heart rate and other data is an added advantage, where the integration of artificial intelligence is possible This can improve clinical decision-making paths In this perspective, the most relevant piezo- and pyro-electric sensor-based wearable sensors for healthcare monitoring towards the early detection of virus-affected abnormalities are highlighted To implement these types of sensors, the relevant fundamentals of piezo- and pyro-electricity are also discussed Additionally, relevant materials and device structures are reviewed in order to understand the pros and cons, and thus further improvement can be applied according to the requirements The envisioned strategy for the early detection of virus-suspected patients through non-invasive wearable sensors is becoming very important in non-contact-based physiological data collection, particularly in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"The Role of Moral Foundations, Anticipated Guilt and Personal Responsibility in Predicting Anti-consumption for Environmental Reasons","In response to the growing importance of environmental issues, more and more consumers are turning to anti-consumption by reducing, rejecting, or avoiding consumption. Covering the intersection of sustainable consumption and anti-consumption, previous studies relied on socio-cognitive models to explain this decision. In order to extend their findings, we consider the moral and emotional perspectives to examine reducing consumption for environmental reasons in a particular context, i.e. air travel. It is against this backdrop that we propose a conceptual model that includes moral foundations as the main antecedent, followed by anticipated guilt and personal responsibility, while intention to reduce consumption (i.e. air travel) for environmental reasons, positive word of mouth about reducing air travel (WOM) and environmental activism represent the outcomes. The proposed model is tested on a sample of 511 respondents from a UK online consumer panel. Our results confirm the importance of moral foundations, anticipated guilt and personal responsibility and their interplay in the prediction of intention to reduce consumption for environmental reasons. Anticipated guilt influences WOM, while personal responsibility influences activism. In addition, intentions to reduce consumption for environmental reasons have a positive impact on WOM and environmental activism. There are several implications for public policy makers and NGOs that fight against climate change that derive from these findings, as well as research opportunities for academics interested in this topic.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Whole-genome sequencing to track SARS-CoV-2 transmission in nosocomial outbreaks,"BACKGROUND: During the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in healthcare institutions posed a significant problem Due to limited evidence, guidance on appropriate infection prevention and control (IPC) measures such as the wearing of face masks varied Here, we applied whole virus genome sequencing (WvGS) to analyse transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital-acquired (HA) COVID-19 METHODS: An investigation was undertaken for all HA cases of COVID-19 from March to April 2020 Fifty SARS-CoV-2 samples were analysed by WvGS and their phylogenetic relationship established RESULTS: WvGS identified transmission events previously undetected by epidemiological analysis and provided evidence for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between healthcare workers (HCW) and patients and among HCW themselves The majority of HA COVID-19 cases occurred in patients highly dependent on nursing care, suggesting the likely route of transmission was by close contact or droplet, rather than aerosol, transmission Mortality among HA COVID-19 infections was recorded as 33% CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs from symptomatic and asymptomatic HCWs to patients Interventions including comprehensive screening of HCWs for COVID-19 symptoms, PCR testing of asymptomatic HCWs upon identification of HA cases and implementation of universal use of surgical masks for all clinical care is indicated to prevent viral transmission Our study highlights the importance of close collaboration between guidance bodies and frontline IPC experts for developing control measures in an emergency pandemic situation caused by a virus with undefined transmission modus",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
The Hydra-Headed Coronaviruses: Implications of COVID-19 for Homeopathy.,"Successful homeopathic prescriptions are based on careful individualization of symptoms, either for an individual patient or collectively in the case of epidemic outbreaks. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic was initially represented as a severe acute respiratory illness, with eventual dramatic complications. However, over time it revealed to be a complex systemic disease with manifestations derived from viral-induced inflammation and hypercoagulability, thus liable to affect any body organ or system. As a result, clinical presentation is variable, in addition to variations associated with several individual and collective risk factors. Given the extreme variability of pathology and clinical manifestations, a single, or a few, universal homeopathic preventive Do not split medicine(s) do not seem feasible. Yet homeopathy may have a relevant role to play, inasmuch as the vast majority of patients only exhibit the mild form of disease and are indicated to self-care at home, without standard monitoring, follow-up, or treatment. For future pandemics, homeopathy agencies should prepare by establishing rapid-response teams and efficacious lines of communication.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Turkey industry strategies for control of respiratory and enteric diseases,"Abstract Current strategies to control respiratory and enteric diseases of turkeys involve sanitation and biosecurity practices to prevent the introduction of infectious agents. In addition, proper husbandry and management practice reduce stress and help maintain a competent immune system. Industry-wide monitoring programs are used in conjunction with isolation, depopulation, and orderly marketing to eliminate pathogens that cause serious economic loss. Vaccines are available and utilized against some pathogens. Effective drug treatment is available and used for some diseases but is most commonly used to control secondary disease losses when treatment is not available for the primary disease.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Optimal periodic closure for minimizing risk in emerging disease outbreaks,"Without vaccines and treatments, societies must rely on non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies to control the spread of emerging diseases such as COVID-19. Though complete lockdown is epidemiologically effective, because it eliminates infectious contacts, it comes with significant costs. Several recent studies have suggested that a plausible compromise strategy for minimizing epidemic risk is periodic closure, in which populations oscillate between wide-spread social restrictions and relaxation. However, no underlying theory has been proposed to predict and explain optimal closure periods as a function of epidemiological and social parameters. In this work we develop such an analytical theory for SEIR-like model diseases, showing how characteristic closure periods emerge that minimize the total outbreak, and increase predictably with the reproductive number and incubation periods of a disease- as long as both are within predictable limits. Using our approach we demonstrate a sweet-spot effect in which optimal periodic closure is maximally effective for diseases with similar incubation and recovery periods. Our results compare well to numerical simulations, including in COVID-19 models where infectivity and recovery show significant variation.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Viral respiratory infections diagnosed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction in pediatric patients,"Syndromic diagnosis by multiplex nucleic acid amplification tests is the most practical approach to respiratory tract infections since the symptoms are rarely agent‐specific. The aim of this study was to investigate the respiratory viruses in children admitted to a university hospital with acute respiratory tract infection during the last 8 years by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. A total of 3162 respiratory samples collected from children between April 2011 and April 2018 tested by a multiplex real‐time PCR assay. Two different commercial assays were used during the study period, ""AusDiagnostics/Respiratory Pathogens 12 (AusDiagnostics)"" used between April 2011 and December 2015, which changed to ""Fast Track Diagnostics/Respiratory Pathogens 21 (Fast Track Diagnostics)"" after January 2016 to cover more viruses. Nucleic acid extraction was done by EZ1 Advanced XL platform (QIAGEN). Respiratory pathogens detected in 1857 of the 3162 (58.7%) samples. The most prevalent viruses during the 8‐year period were rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV; 36.2%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; 19%), and influenza virus A/B (14.7%). Rhinovirus was the main contributor to the RV/EV group as shown by the assay used during the 2016‐2018 period. RV/EV and adenoviruses detected throughout the year. Influenza virus was most frequently detected during January to March when both RSV and metapneumovirus were also in circulation. The coinfection percentage was 10.2%. Rhinovirus was the most common virus in coinfections while RSV plus rhinovirus/enterovirus were the most frequent combination. RSV and metapneumovirus showed a similar seasonal distribution to the influenza virus, which made it necessary to use a virological diagnostic assay during the influenza season.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
A New Day: The Role of Telemedicine in Reshaping Care for Persons with Movement Disorders,"The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the fragility of clinic-based care for Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders. In response to the virus, many clinics across the world abruptly closed their doors to persons with Parkinson's disease. Fortunately, a niche care model, telemedicine-first described in this journal a generation ago-emerged as the dominant means of providing care. As we adjust to a new normal, we should focus future care not on clinics but on patients. Their needs, guided by clinicians, should determine how care is delivered, whether in the clinic, at home, remotely, or by some combination. Within this patient-centered approach, telemedicine is an attractive care option but not a complete replacement for in-person consultations, which are valuable for specific problems and for those who have access. Now that many clinicians and patients have gained exposure to telemedicine, we can better appreciate its advantages (eg, convenience) and disadvantages (eg, restricted examination). We can also create a new future that utilizes the Internet, video conferencing, smartphones, and sensors. This future will bring many clinicians to one patient, connect individual experts to countless patients, use widely available devices to facilitate diagnosis, and apply novel technologies to measure the disease in new ways. These approaches, which extend to education and research, enable a future where we can care for anyone anywhere and will help us stem the tide of Parkinson's disease. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Climate Solutions Double as Health Interventions,"The climate crisis threatens to exacerbate numerous climate-sensitive health risks, including heatwave mortality, malnutrition from reduced crop yields, water- and vector-borne infectious diseases, and respiratory illness from smog, ozone, allergenic pollen, and wildfires. Recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stress the urgent need for action to mitigate climate change, underscoring the need for more scientific assessment of the benefits of climate action for health and wellbeing. Project Drawdown has analyzed more than 80 solutions to address climate change, building on existing technologies and practices, that could be scaled to collectively limit warming to between 1.5° and 2 °C above preindustrial levels. The solutions span nine major sectors and are aggregated into three groups: reducing the sources of emissions, maintaining and enhancing carbon sinks, and addressing social inequities. Here we present an overview of how climate solutions in these three areas can benefit human health through improved air quality, increased physical activity, healthier diets, reduced risk of infectious disease, and improved sexual and reproductive health, and universal education. We find that the health benefits of a low-carbon society are more substantial and more numerous than previously realized and should be central to policies addressing climate change. Much of the existing literature focuses on health effects in high-income countries, however, and more research is needed on health and equity implications of climate solutions, especially in the Global South. We conclude that adding the myriad health benefits across multiple climate change solutions can likely add impetus to move climate policies faster and further.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
The Role of Sugar Transporter CsSWEET7a in Apoplasmic Phloem Unloading in Receptacle and Nectary During Cucumber Anthesis,"During anthesis, there is an increased demand for carbohydrates due to pollen maturation and nectary secretion that warrants a systematic phloem unloading strategy for sugar partitioning. Sugar transporters are key components of the apoplasmic phloem unloading strategy and control the sugar flux needed for plant development. Currently, the phloem unloading strategy during anthesis has not been explored in cucumber, and the question of which sugar transporters are active during flower anthesis is poorly understood. In this study, a study utilizing the phloem-mobile symplasmic tracer carboxyfluorescein (CF) suggested that the phloem unloading was symplasmically isolated in the receptacle and nectary of cucumber flowers at anthesis. We also identified a hexose transporter that is highly expressed in cucumber flower, Sugar Will Eventually be Exported Transporter 7a (SWEET7a). CsSWEET7a was mainly expressed in receptacle and nectary tissues in both male and female flowers, where its expression level increased rapidly right before anthesis. At anthesis, the CsSWEET7a protein was specifically localized to the phloem region of the receptacle and nectary, indicating that CsSWEET7a may function in the apoplasmic phloem unloading during flower anthesis. Although cucumber mainly transports raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs) in the phloem, sucrose, glucose, and fructose are the major sugars in the flower receptacle and the nectary as well as in nectar at anthesis. In addition, the transcript levels of genes encoding soluble sugar hydrolases (α-galactosidase, sucrose synthase, cytoplasmic invertase, and cell wall invertase) were correlated with that of CsSWEET7a. These results indicated that CsSWEET7a may be involved in sugar partitioning as an exporter in the phloem of the receptacle and nectary to supply carbohydrates for flower anthesis and nectar secretion in cucumber.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

"Remotely delivered information, training and support for informal caregivers of people with dementia","BACKGROUND: Many people with dementia are cared for at home by unpaid informal caregivers, usually family members. Caregivers may experience a range of physical, emotional, financial and social harms, which are often described collectively as caregiver burden. The degree of burden experienced is associated with characteristics of the caregiver, such as gender, and characteristics of the person with dementia, such as dementia stage, and the presence of behavioural problems or neuropsychiatric disturbances. It is a strong predictor of admission to residential care for people with dementia. Psychoeducational interventions might prevent or reduce caregiver burden. Overall, they are intended to improve caregivers' knowledge about the disease and its care; to increase caregivers' sense of competence and their ability to cope with difficult situations; to relieve feelings of isolation and allow caregivers to attend to their own emotional and physical needs. These interventions are heterogeneous, varying in their theoretical framework, components, and delivery formats. Interventions that are delivered remotely, using printed materials, telephone or video technologies, may be particularly suitable for caregivers who have difficulty accessing face-to-face services because of their own health problems, poor access to transport, or absence of substitute care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, containment measures in many countries required people to be isolated in their homes, including people with dementia and their family carers. In such circumstances, there is no alternative to remote delivery of interventions. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and acceptability of remotely delivered interventions aiming to reduce burden and improve mood and quality of life of informal caregivers of people with dementia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, MEDLINE, Embase and four other databases, as well as two international trials registries, on 10 April 2020. We also examined the bibliographies of relevant review papers and published trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included only randomised controlled trials that assessed the remote delivery of structured interventions for informal caregivers who were providing care for people with dementia living at home. Caregivers had to be unpaid adults (relatives or members of the person's community). The interventions could be delivered using printed materials, the telephone, the Internet or a mixture of these, but could not involve any face-to-face contact with professionals. We categorised intervention components as information, training or support. Information interventions included two key elements: (i) they provided standardised information, and (ii) the caregiver played a passive role. Support interventions promoted interaction with other people (professionals or peers). Training interventions trained caregivers in practical skills to manage care. We excluded interventions that were primarily individual psychotherapy. Our primary outcomes were caregiver burden, mood, health-related quality of life and dropout for any reason. Secondary outcomes were caregiver knowledge and skills, use of health and social care resources, admission of the person with dementia to institutional care, and quality of life of the person with dementia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Study selection, data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias in included studies were done independently by two review authors. We used the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) to describe the interventions. We conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model to derive estimates of effect size. We used GRADE methods to describe our degree of certainty about effect estimates. MAIN RESULTS: We included 26 studies in this review (2367 participants). We compared (1) interventions involving training, support or both, with or without information (experimental interventions) with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control (12 studies, 944 participants); and (2) the same experimental interventions with provision of information alone (14 studies, 1423 participants). We downgraded evidence for study limitations and, for some outcomes, for inconsistency between studies. There was a frequent risk of bias from self-rating of subjective outcomes by participants who were not blind to the intervention. Randomisation methods were not always well-reported and there was potential for attrition bias in some studies. Therefore, all evidence was of moderate or low certainty. In the comparison of experimental interventions with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control, we found that the experimental interventions probably have little or no effect on caregiver burden (nine studies, 597 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.35 to 0.23); depressive symptoms (eight studies, 638 participants; SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.12); or health-related quality of life (two studies, 311 participants; SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.32). The experimental interventions probably result in little or no difference in dropout for any reason (eight studies, 661 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.53). In the comparison of experimental interventions with a control condition of information alone, we found that experimental interventions may result in a slight reduction in caregiver burden (nine studies, 650 participants; SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.51 to 0.04); probably result in a slight improvement in depressive symptoms (11 studies, 1100 participants; SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.06); may result in little or no difference in caregiver health-related quality of life (two studies, 257 participants; SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.21); and probably result in an increase in dropouts for any reason (12 studies, 1266 participants; RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.20). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Remotely delivered interventions including support, training or both, with or without information, may slightly reduce caregiver burden and improve caregiver depressive symptoms when compared with provision of information alone, but not when compared with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control. They seem to make little or no difference to health-related quality of life.

Drug repurposing and polypharmacology to fight SARS-CoV-2 through the inhibition of the main protease,"Therapeutic options are urgently needed to fight the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the COVID-19 disease and is spreading rapidly around the world. Drug repurposing can significantly accelerate the identification of drug candidates suitable for clinical evaluation. Moreover, polypharmacological effects may increase antiviral activity and/or counteract severe complications concurrently affecting COVID-19 patients. Herein, we present the results of a computational drug repurposing campaign in search of potential inhibitors of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The screening allowed the selection of 22 promising drugs. Some of them have already entered clinical trials, but the vast majority of the identified compounds are new and have never been considered before. For each repurposed compound, its therapeutic relevance and potential beneficial polypharmacological effects that may arise due to its original therapeutic indication are thoroughly discussed.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Jumper Enables Discontinuous Transcript Assembly in Coronaviruses,"Genes in SARS-CoV-2 and, more generally, in viruses in the order of Nidovirales are expressed by a process of discontinuous transcription mediated by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This process is distinct from alternative splicing in eukaryotes, rendering current transcript assembly methods unsuitable to Nidovirales sequencing samples. Here, we introduce the Discontinuous Transcript Assembly problem of finding transcripts and their abundances c given an alignment under a maximum likelihood model that accounts for varying transcript lengths. Underpinning our approach is the concept of a segment graph, a directed acyclic graph that, distinct from the splice graph used to characterize alternative splicing, has a unique Hamiltonian path. We provide a compact characterization of solutions as subsets of non-overlapping edges in this graph, enabling the formulation of an efficient mixed integer linear program. We show using simulations that our method, Jumper, drastically outperforms existing methods for classical transcript assembly. On short-read data of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 samples, we find that Jumper not only identifies canonical transcripts that are part of the reference transcriptome, but also predicts expression of non-canonical transcripts that are well supported by direct evidence from long-read data, presence in multiple, independent samples or a conserved core sequence. Jumper enables detailed analyses of Nidovirales transcriptomes. Code availability Software is available at https://github.com/elkebir-group/Jumper",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
The burden of type 2 diabetes pre-and during the COVID-19 pandemic – a review,"INTRODUCTION: Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic disease and a global epidemic. It is a known fact that co-morbidities, including Diabetes Mellitus, pose a higher risk of infection by COVID-19. Additionally, the outcomes following infection are far worse than in people without such co-morbities. Factors contributing to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have long been established, yet this disease still bestows a substantial global burden. The aim was to provide a comprehensive review of the burden of diabetes pre-COVID-19 and the additional impact sustained by the diabetes population and healthcare systems during the COVID-19 pandemic, while providing recommendations of how this burden can be subsided. METHODOLOGY: Literature searches were carried out on ‘Google Scholar’ and ‘PubMed’ to identify relevant articles for the scope of this review. Information was also collected from reliable sources such as the World Health Organisation and the International Diabetes Federation. RESULTS: T2DM presented with economic, social and health burdens prior to COVID-19 with an significant ‘Disability Adjusted Life Years’ impact. Whilst people with diabetes are more susceptible to COVID-19, enforcing lockdown regulations set by the Public Health department to reduce risk of infection brought about its own challenges to T2DM management. Through recommendations and adapting to new methods of management such as telehealth, these challenges and potential consequences of mismanagement are kept to a minimum whilst safeguarding the healthcare system. CONCLUSION: By understanding the challenges and burdens faced by this population both evident pre-covid and during, targeted healthcare can be provided during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, implementation of targeted action plans and recommendations ensures the care provided is done in a safe and effective environment.

An Update on the Role of Nrf2 in Respiratory Disease: Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Approaches,"Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) is a transcriptional activator of the cell protection gene that binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE). Therefore, Nrf2 protects cells and tissues from oxidative stress. Normally, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) inhibits the activation of Nrf2 by binding to Nrf2 and contributes to Nrf2 break down by ubiquitin proteasomes. In moderate oxidative stress, Keap1 is inhibited, allowing Nrf2 to be translocated to the nucleus, which acts as an antioxidant. However, under unusually severe oxidative stress, the Keap1-Nrf2 mechanism becomes disrupted and results in cell and tissue damage. Oxide-containing atmospheric environment generally contributes to the development of respiratory diseases, possibly leading to the failure of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. Until now, several studies have identified changes in Keap1-Nrf2 signaling in models of respiratory diseases, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)/acute lung injury (ALI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and asthma. These studies have confirmed that several Nrf2 activators can alleviate symptoms of respiratory diseases. Thus, this review describes how the expression of Keap1-Nrf2 functions in different respiratory diseases and explains the protective effects of reversing this expression.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Self-flip Technique of the TightRope RT Button for Soft-Tissue Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.,"The TightRope RT (Arthrex, Naples, FL) is a suspensory device for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. However, there is a potential risk of the button being pulled too far off the lateral femoral cortex into the soft tissue because the adjustable loop is long. The purpose of this article is to present an easy and safe technique for self-flip. As to the preparation of the graft, we draw the first line in the loop of the TightRope RT at the same length as the femoral tunnel, and we draw the second line 7 mm longer than the length of the femoral tunnel as a self-flip line. Concerning passing of the graft, the side sutures are pulled from the lateral side. We stop pulling the sutures just at the self-flip line by holding the graft at the tibial end. The side suture is inclined to the medial side with strong pulling of the suture at full extension of the knee. Then the surgeon pulls the tibial end of the graft to feel a secure positioning of the button on the lateral femoral cortex. Although it has limitations, the present technique is easy and certainly helps surgeons achieve appropriate positioning of the button.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Environmental implications of reduced electricity consumption in Wuhan during COVID-19 outbreak: A brief study,"Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Wuhan was locked down from 23 January 2020 to 8 April 2020, a total of 76 days. It is well known that the electricity consumption is a direct reflection of human activity. During the lockdown of Wuhan, most of human activities were forbidden. The reduction in human activity would inevitably lead to a reduction in electricity consumption. At the same time, anthropogenic emissions of air pollutants would also be reduced with the reduction of human activity. In this study, the correlation between electricity consumption and air pollutants during lockdown was discussed in detail. The result showed that the drop in pollutants concentrations in January should be attributed to the washout effect of rainfall rather than the lockdown. The decrease of electricity consumption in the secondary industry might play a significant role on the decrease of PM [Formula: see text] and NO(2) concentrations in Wuhan in February 2020. The decrease in NO(2) concentration in March should be attributed to the reduction of pollutants emissions from the tertiary industry, which means that more attention should be paid to the control of NO(2) emission in the tertiary industry. Due to reduced emissions from local sources, the role of long-range transport sources might be more significant during the lockdown of Wuhan. By PSCF analysis, southeast of Wuhan could be the major potential emission sources of PM [Formula: see text] , especially in the northern part of Jiangxi province. It was suggested that stricter regulation of pollutants emissions should be implemented in this area.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Radiological manifestations from 101 patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in Hamadan, West of Iran: Typical and atypical findings","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread widely throughout the world and become a pandemic disease. In this study we decided to investigate the chest computed tomography (CT) findings in COVID-19 patients in Hamadan, west of Iran. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted on 101 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from February to March 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and chest CT information of identified COVID-19 patients were assessed. Results Totally, 101 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. The mean age of the patients was 55.21 ± 14.08 years and 54% (53.47%) of them were male. With regards to clinical manifestations, 82.18%, 72.28% and 54.46% of COVID-19 patients had dry cough, dyspnea and fever, respectively and 44.5% had lymphopenia. The right lower lobe was the most common (69%) and severe involved lobe followed by left lower lobe, right middle lobe, and lingual;however, anterior segment of upper lobes showed least involvement with abnormality in the late course of disease. The most common pattern is ground glass opacity, but atypical patterns such as round pneumonia, moderate to severe plural effusion and segmental lobar collapse consolidation was seen without evidence of mediastinal adenopathy, cavitation or nodule. Chest X ray (CXR) was not sensitive method as a first line imaging because 34.65% of them were normal. Conclusion CXR is not sensitive method as first line imaging too (34.65% normal first CXR), but Chest CT is very sensitive and nonspecific modality for diagnosis of COVID – 19. Lower lobe and posterior basal predominance involvements were seen in most cases. About 12% showed atypical chest CT features.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Structural architecture of an RNA that competitively inhibits RNase L.,"Activation of RNase L endonuclease activity is part of the mammalian innate immune response to viral infection. The poliovirus RNA genome contains a sequence in its protein-coding region that can act as a competitive inhibitor of RNase L. Mutation, sequence, and functional analysis of this competitive inhibitor RNA (ciRNA) revealed that its activity depends on specific sequences, showed that a loop-loop hairpin interaction forms in the ciRNA, and suggested the presence of a loop E motif. These features lead to the hypothesis that the ciRNA's function is conferred in part by a specific three-dimensional folded RNA architecture. By using a combination of biophysical, mutational, and functional studies, we have mapped features of the three-dimensional architecture of the ciRNA in its unbound form. We show that the loop-loop interaction forms in the free ciRNA and affects the overall structure, perhaps forming long-range tertiary interactions with the loop E motif. Local tight RNA-RNA backbone packing occurs in parts of the structure, but the fold appears to be less stable than many other tightly packed RNAs. This feature may allow the ciRNA to accommodate the translocation of ribosomes and polymerase across this multifunctional region of the viral RNA but also to function as an RNase L inhibitor.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Heard, valued, supported? Doctors' wellbeing during transitions triggered by COVID‐19","INTRODUCTION: Supporting doctors' wellbeing is crucial for medical education to help minimise negative long‐term impacts on medical workforce retention and ultimately patient care. There is limited study of how doctors' transitions experiences impact wellbeing, particularly socially and culturally. Multiple Multidimensional Transitions (MMT) theory views transitions as dynamic, incorporating multiple contexts and multiple domains. Using MMT as our lens, we report a qualitative analysis of how transitions experienced by doctors during the pandemic impacted on social and cultural aspects of wellbeing. METHODS: Longitudinal narrative inquiry was employed, using interviews and audio‐diaries. Data were collected over 6 months in three phases: (i) interviews with doctors from across the career spectrum (n = 98); (ii) longitudinal audio‐diaries for 2–4 months (n = 71); (iii) second interviews (n = 83). Data were analysed abductively, narrowing focus to factors important to social and cultural wellbeing. RESULTS: Doctors described experiencing multiple interacting transitions triggered by the pandemic in multiple contexts (workplace, role, homelife and education). Patterns identifiable across the dataset allowed us to explore social and cultural wellbeing crosscutting beyond individual experience. Three critical factors contributed to social and cultural wellbeing both positively and negatively: being heard (e.g., by colleagues asking how they are); being valued (e.g., removal of rest spaces by organisations showing lack of value); and being supported (e.g., through regular briefing by education bodies). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to longitudinally explore the multiple‐multidimensional transitions experienced by doctors during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Our data analysis helped us move beyond existing perceptions around wellbeing and articulate multiple factors that contribute to social and cultural wellbeing. It is vital that medical educators consider the learning from these experiences to help pinpoint what aspects of support might be beneficial to trainee doctors and their trainers. This study forms the basis for developing evidenced‐based interventions that ensure doctors are heard, valued and supported.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Youth athletes sleep more, practice less, and may lose interest in playing sports due to social distancing mandates","In-person sport participation was suspended across the United States in the spring of 2020 to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The purpose of this study was to survey the impact of COVID-19 on young athletes during a period of social and organized sports restrictions. An anonymous cross-sectional survey study was conducted of youth athletes in the midst of social distancing mandates and consisted of six components: demographics, sport participation, changes in sport-related goals/aspirations, sleep habits, and measures of anxiety and depression. 711 individuals who accessed the survey link yielded 575 (81%) participants with responses available for analysis. All respondents (aged 13.0 years) played organized sports, 62% were single-sport athletes, and 74% considered high-level. Participants were training ∼3.3 h less per week, spending more time outside, and 86% of participants continued to train while social distancing. Sleep duration increased (∼1.2 h/night) and sleep quality improved in 29% of young athletes. Additionally, 22% and 28% reported PROMIS® anxiety and depression scores characterized as ‘mild’, ‘moderate’, or ‘severe’. Older single-sport participants reported higher depression scores, while higher anxiety scores were seen in female participants with fewer years played. 10% of young athletes and 20% of teenagers changed their sports-related goals. Training style modifications, decreased training, and increased sleep quantity and quality were positive effects of COVID-19 restrictions, while athletic aspirational changes were undesirable effects. Single-sport athletes may be at greater risk for psychological symptoms when their routine is altered.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Impact of COVID-19 on Canadian medical oncologists and cancer care: Canadian Association of Medical Oncologists survey report,"Background: The covid-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented professional and personal challenges for the oncology community. Under the auspices of the Canadian Association of Medical Oncologists, we conducted an online national survey to better understand the impact of the pandemic on the medical oncology community in Canada. Methods: An English-language multiple-choice survey, including questions about demographics, covid-19 risk, use of personal protective equipment (ppe), personal challenges, and chemotherapy management was distributed to Canadian medical oncologists. The survey was open from 30 March to 4 April 2020, and attracted 159 responses. Results: More than 70% of medical oncologists expressed moderate-to-extreme concern about personally contracting covid-19 and about family members or patients (or both) contracting covid-19 from them. Despite that high level of concern, considerable variability in the use of ppe in direct cancer care was reported at the time of this survey, with 33% of respondents indicating no routine ppe use at their institutions and 69% indicating uncertainty about access to adequate ppe. Of the respondents, 54% were experiencing feelings of nervousness or anxiety on most days, and 52% were having feelings of depression or hopelessness on at least some days. Concern about aging parents or family and individual wellness represented the top personal challenges identified. The management of cancer patients has been affected, with adoption of telemedicine reported by 82% of respondents, and cessation of clinical trial accrual reported by 54%. The 3 factors deemed most important for treatment decision-making wereâ cancer prognosis and anticipated benefit from treatment,â risk of treatment toxicity during scarce health care access, andâ patient risk of contracting covid-19. Conclusions: This report describes the results of the first national survey assessing the impact of the covid-19 on Canadian medical oncologists and how they deliver systemic anticancer therapies. We hope that these data will provide a framework to address the challenges identified.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
High diversity in Delta variant across countries revealed by genome‐wide analysis of SARS‐CoV‐2 beyond the Spike protein,"The highly contagious Delta variant of SARS‐CoV‐2 has become a prevalent strain globally and poses a public health challenge around the world. While there has been extensive focus on understanding the amino acid mutations in the Delta variant’s Spike protein, the mutational landscape of the rest of the SARS‐CoV‐2 proteome (25 proteins) remains poorly understood. To this end, we performed a systematic analysis of mutations in all the SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins from nearly 2 million SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes from 176 countries/territories. Six highly prevalent missense mutations in the viral life cycle‐associated Membrane (I82T), Nucleocapsid (R203M, D377Y), NS3 (S26L), and NS7a (V82A, T120I) proteins are almost exclusive to the Delta variant compared to other variants of concern (mean prevalence across genomes: Delta = 99.74%, Alpha = 0.06%, Beta = 0.09%, and Gamma = 0.22%). Furthermore, we find that the Delta variant harbors a more diverse repertoire of mutations across countries compared to the previously dominant Alpha variant. Overall, our study underscores the high diversity of the Delta variant between countries and identifies a list of amino acid mutations in the Delta variant’s proteome for probing the mechanistic basis of pathogenic features such as high viral loads, high transmissibility, and reduced susceptibility against neutralization by vaccines.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Biospecimen Collection During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Considerations for Biobanking,"OBJECTIVES: Millions of biospecimens will be collected during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As learned from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), proper biospecimen handling is necessary to prevent laboratory-related infections. METHODS: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) interim biosafety guidelines continue to be updated. Presented here are additional considerations intended to complement the interim guidance. These considerations draw on prior SARS recommendations and recent COVID-19 reports. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has been detected in various biospecimen types; however, studies are needed to determine whether viral load indicates viable virus. Throughout the pandemic, biospecimens will be collected for various purposes from COVID-19 known and suspected cases, as well as presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Current data suggest the pandemic start may be as early as October 2019; thus, all biospecimens collected since could be considered potentially infectious. CONCLUSIONS: All entities handling these biospecimens should do risk assessments in accordance with institutional policies and adhere to any guidance provided. The scientific community has a responsibility to safely handle and maintain all biospecimens collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Soon, it will be imperative to convene expert working groups to address the current and long-term storage and use of these biospecimens. Ideally, worldwide guidelines will be established to protect the personnel handling these biospecimens and communities at large.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"SARS‐CoV nucleocapsid protein binds to hUbc9, a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme of the sumoylation system","SARS‐CoV is a newly identified coronavirus (CoV) that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The SARS‐CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein is an important structural and functional protein. To identify cellular proteins that interact with the SARS‐CoV N protein and to elucidate the possible involvement of N protein in SARS‐CoV pathogenesis, a human lymphocyte cDNA library was screened using a yeast two‐hybrid system assay. hUbc9, a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme of sumoylation system, was found to interact specifically with the N protein, implying the post‐translational sumoylation of the N protein. Mapping studies localized the critical N sequences for this interaction to amino acids 170–210, which includes the SR‐rich motif. However, the consensus motif of sumoylation GK(62)EE in the N protein is not responsible for binding to hUbc9. Mutations of hUbc9 at the enzyme active site C93A or C93S severely impair the interaction with the N protein. The two proteins were also shown to colocalize in the cytoplasm of the transfected 293T cells. This is the first report demonstrating the interaction of hUbc9 with a structural protein of plus‐strand RNA viruses, indicating a new drug target for SARS‐CoV. J. Med.

The Extent of Myocardial Injury During Prolonged Targeted Temperature Management After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest.,"AIM The aim of this study is to evaluate the extent of myocardial injury by cardiac biomarkers during prolonged targeted temperature management of 24 hours vs 48 hours after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. METHODS This randomized Scandinavian multicenter study compares the extent of myocardial injury quantified by area under the curve (AUC) of cardiac biomarkers during prolonged targeted temperature management at 33°C ± 1°C of 24 hours and 48 hours, respectively. Through a period of 2.5 years, 161 comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients were randomized to targeted temperature management for 24 hours (n = 77) or 48 hours (n = 84). The AUC was calculated using both high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnTAUC) and creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MBAUC) that were based upon measurements of these biomarkers every 6 hours upon admission until 96 hours after reaching target temperature. RESULTS The median hs-cTnTAUC of 33,827 ng/L/h (interquartile range [IQR] 11,366-117,690) of targeted temperature management at 24 hours did not differ significantly from that of 28,973 ng/L/h (IQR 10,656-163,655) at 48 hours. In contrast, the median CK-MBAUC of 1829 μg/L/h (IQR 800-6799) during targeted temperature management at 24 hours was significantly lower than that of 2428 μg/L/h (IQR 1163-10,906) within targeted temperature management at 48 hours, P <.05. CONCLUSION This study of comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors showed no difference between the extents of myocardial injury estimated by hs-cTnTAUC of prolonged targeted temperature management of 48 hours vs 24 hours, although the CK-MBAUC was significantly higher during 48 hours vs 24 hours. Hence, it seems unlikely that the duration of targeted temperature management has a beneficial effect on the extent of myocardial injury after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and may even have a worsening effect.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Online Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for People with Parkinson’s Disease and Their Caregivers: a Pilot Study,"Anxiety and depression are common non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Caregivers of people with PD may experience severe caregiver burden. This study explored the feasibility and potential benefits of an online mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) intervention for improving anxiety and depressive symptoms in people with PD and their caregivers (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04469049, 7/8/2020). People with PD or parkinsonism and anxiety and/or depressive symptoms and caregivers of people with PD participated in one of three online MBCT groups. Demographic variables, pre- and post-MBCT behavioral measures (GAD-7, PHQ-9, Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire — FFMQ-15, Caregiver Self-Assessment Questionnaire — CSAQ), and satisfaction surveys were collected. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data. Pre- and post-MBCT behavioral scores were compared using mixed-effect models. Fifty-six potential participants were assessed for eligibility. Twenty-eight entered MBCT groups; all but one completed the intervention. The overall sample analyzed (22 people with PD, 4 caregivers) showed significant GAD-7 and PHQ-9 score reductions and FFMQ-15 total and observing and non-reactivity subscale score increases (all p’s < 0.05). Participants with PD and anxiety symptoms (n = 14) had a significant GAD-7 score reduction; those with PD and depressive symptoms (n = 12) had a significant PHQ-9 score reduction (both p’s < 0.05). Participants with PD also had a significant FFMQ-15 observing subscale score increase (p < 0.05). The caregiver sample was too small to be analyzed separately. Online MBCT is feasible (as measured by high attendance, completion rate, and participant satisfaction) and may be effective in improving anxiety and depressive symptoms in people with PD.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Biofield Frequency Bands-Definitions and Group Differences.,"Background In the biofield literature, it is suggested that electromagnetic energy is part of the biofield. However, little is known about the exact definition of potential electromagnetic biofield frequency bands (FBs).Primary Study Objective: The current study sought to identify biofield FBs and test potential group differences.Methods/Design: High-frequency (i.e. >200 Hertz) voltage was measured at body parts along the spine and the brain. Setting Measurements were conducted in an electrically shielded laboratory. Participants Twenty experienced biofield practitioners (BPs, sample 1) and twenty-four students (STs, sample 2) participated in the study. Interventions The BPs performed a wide set of biofield exercises, while the STs participated in an assessment centre (with exercises such as role play).

Vulnerability of the Population of Moscow Districts to Natural Hazards,"The frequency of natural hazards, such as heat waves, epidemics, floods, hurricanes etc tends to increase both in Russia and abroad Under the climate change, population aging and accelerating mobi lity, increased urban density and environment degradation the residents of large cities are becoming more vulnerable to the consequences of such events According to experts, more than 11 thousand people be came victims of 2010 extreme summer temperatures in Moscow The effects of the coronavirus epidemic are y et to be assessed, and it is important to study the socio-economic differences of Moscow districts in t he context of crisis and expanding pandemic, considering the negative consequences for health and life of residents The authors propose a natural hazard vulnerability index for Moscow districts The index accounts for the proportion of the most susceptible part of the population, as well as the possibility of ada ptation of residents Such social strata as pensioners, disabled persons, residents of poorer areas and migr ants are the most vulnerable, i e incapable of self-protection or leaving a disaster area because of physica l or financial restrictions It was found that since 2010 the vulnerability of population has increased i n 104 of 125 Moscow districts, as a result of increasing numbers of elderly and disabled people, and decreasi ng incomes in the depressed areas Priority territories for implementing the policy of adaptation to ha zardous events are in Zelenograd (Matushkino, Savelki, Staroe Kryukovo, Kryukovo, Silino), in the southeast (Nekrasovka, Veshnyaki) and the northeast (Northern Izmailovo, Metrogorodok, Golyanovo) parts of the capital The adaptability in central districts, subjected to gentrification, is increasing due to th e growing proportion of wealthy citizens As a result of the 2020 crisis, associated with the pandemic and the fall in oil prices, a decrease in household incomes could further aggravate the vulnerability of residents of the majority of Moscow districts;the most negative consequences are expected in more vulnerable areas The results allow m ore precise application of natural hazards monitoring, warning and adaptation tools For example, the ab ove- mentioned vulnerable areas are in need of providing the timely ambulance access and raising awarenes s of the elderly locals and migrants В России и за рубежом наблюдается рост повторяемости опасных природных явлений, в том числе пиковых термических условий, эпидемий, наводнений, ураганов и др В результате изменений климата, старения и роста мобильности населения, увеличения плотности застройки, ухудшения экологической ситуации, жители крупных городов становятся более уязвимы к последствиям подобных событий Так, по оценкам экспертов в Москве более 11 тыс человек стали жертвами экстремальных летних температур 2010 г Последствия эпидемии коронавируса только предстоит оценить, но изучение социально-экономических различий районов Москвы актуально в условиях начавшегося кризиса и развернувшейся пандемии с учетом негативных последствий для здоровья и жизни жителей Авторами предложен индекс уязвимости населения районов столицы к опасным природным явлениям Индекс учитывает долю наиболее восприимчивой части населения, а также возможности адаптации жителей Наиболее уязвимы пенсионеры, инвалиды, жители более бедных районов и мигранты - все те слои общества, которые не могут защитить себя или покинуть зону бедствия из-за физических или финансовых ограничений Нами установлено, что с 2010 г в 104 из 125 районах Москвы уязвимость населения выросла за счет роста числа пожилых и маломобильных граждан, сокращения доходов населения в депрессивных районах Приоритетные территории для проведения политики адаптации к опасным явлениям расположены в Зеленограде (Матушкино, Савёлки, Старое Крюково, Крюково, Силино), на юго-востоке (Некрасовка, Вешняки) и северо-востоке (Северное Измайлово, Метрогородок, Гольяново) столицы В центральных районах, подверженных процессам джентрификации, благодаря увеличению доли состоятельных граждан и благоустройству адаптивность росла В результате кризиса 2020 г , связанного с пандемией и падением цен на нефть, сокращение доходов населения может привести к дальнейшему росту уязвимости жителей большинства районов Москвы, а наибольшие негативные последствия ожидаются в более уязвимых районах Результаты позволяют более точечно применять инструменты мониторинга, предупреждения и адаптации к опасным явлениям, в частности в упомянутых районах потребуется обеспечение своевременного доступа скорой помощи и проведение разъяснительной работы с пожилыми жителями и мигрантами",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Application of Electrospun Nonwoven Fibers in Air Filters,"Air filtration has seen a sizable increase in the global market this past year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nanofiber nonwoven mats are able to reach certain efficiencies with a low-pressure drop, have a very high surface area to volume ratio, filter out submicron particulates, and can customize the fiber material to better suit its purpose. Although electrospinning nonwoven mats have been very well studied and documented there are not many papers that combine them. This review touches on the various ways to manufacture nonwoven mats for use as an air filter, with an emphasis on electrospinning, the mechanisms by which the fibrous nonwoven air filter stops particles passing through, and ways that the nonwoven mats can be altered by morphology, structure, and material parameters. Metallic, ceramic, and organic nanoparticle coatings, as well as electrospinning solutions with these same materials and their properties and effects of air filtration, are explored.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Towards Clinical Application of Artificial Intelligence in Ultrasound Imaging,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is being increasingly adopted in medical research and applications. Medical AI devices have continuously been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States and the responsible institutions of other countries. Ultrasound (US) imaging is commonly used in an extensive range of medical fields. However, AI-based US imaging analysis and its clinical implementation have not progressed steadily compared to other medical imaging modalities. The characteristic issues of US imaging owing to its manual operation and acoustic shadows cause difficulties in image quality control. In this review, we would like to introduce the global trends of medical AI research in US imaging from both clinical and basic perspectives.

The COVID-19 multiplier effects of tourism on the Greek economy,"Using a multisectoral model and data from the Supply and Use Tables, this article estimates the COVID-19 multiplier effects of tourism on gross domestic product (GDP), total employment, and trade balance of the Greek economy. The results indicate that a—not-unexpected—decrease of international travel receipts in the range of 3.5 to 10.5 billion euros would lead to a decrease in GDP of about 2.0% to 6.0%, a decrease in the levels of employment of about 2.1% to 6.4% and an increase in the trade balance deficit of about 2.4 to 7.1 billion euros, respectively.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Predicting compassion fatigue among psychological hotline counselors using machine learning techniques,"During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019, psychological hotline counselors frequently address help-seekers’ traumatic experiences from time to time, which possibly causes counselors’ compassion fatigue. The present study aimed to explore the predictors of compassion fatigue among a high-risk population of psychological hotline counselors. Seven hundred and twelve psychological hotline counselors were recruited from the Mental Health Service Platform at Central China Normal University, Ministry of Education, then were asked to complete the questionnaires measuring compassion fatigue, trait empathy, social support, trait mindfulness, counselor’s self-efficacy, humor, life meaning, and post-traumatic growth. A chi-square test was utilized to filter for the top-20 predictive variables. Machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and naïve Bayes were employed to predict compassion fatigue. The results showed that the most important predictors of compassion fatigue were meaning in life, counselors’ self-efficacy, mindfulness, and empathy. Except for the decision tree, the rest machine learning techniques obtained good performance. Naïve Bayes presented the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.803. Random forest achieved the least classification error of 23.64, followed by Naïve Bayes with a classification error of 23.85. These findings support the potential application of machine learning techniques in the prediction of compassion fatigue.

The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among asymptomatic blood donors in Saudi Arabia,"BACKGROUND: In late 2019, cases of severe pneumonia with unidentified etiology began to emerge in Wuhan, China, before progressively spreading first nationally and then globally. The current study sought to investigate the seroprevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among blood donors in Al-Madinah, Saudi Arabia. To our knowledge, this is the first study in Saudi Arabia to screen blood donors who were not known to be previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional study to assess individuals who donated blood to the central blood bank in Al-Madinah between mid-May and mid-July 2020. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was designed and established to detect antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in serum samples. A total of 1,212 healthy blood donors participated in this study. The donors were males and met the requirements for blood donation during the COVID-19 pandemic period in Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among blood donors in Al-Madinah was 19.31% (n = 234/1212; 95% confidence interval: 17.12%–21.64%). No statistically significant difference was identified in seropositivity according to age. However, significant differences (p < 0.001) were identified according to ABO blood groups, with those with type A blood presenting the highest rate of seropositivity (29.18%) compared with the other blood groups (12.65% for type B, 16.36% for type AB, and 15.11% for type O). CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was detected among blood donors in Al-Madinah, which indicated a high level of exposure to the virus within the population. This further suggested that as high as one-fifth of the population may have acquired innate immunity against the virus.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Residual Respiratory Impairment After COVID-19 Pneumonia,"Introduction: the Novel Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19) can infect the respiratory tract, causing mild to deadly respiratory impairment. It is still unknown whether patients recovering from Covid-19 will develop respiratory sequelae. This study aims to evaluate the respiratory and functional condition of Covid-19 recovered patients, stratified according to their worst p/F during hospitalization for Covid-19. Method: 86 Covid-19 recovered subjects performed, after 39 days on average, physical examination and arterial blood gas (ABG) examination, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) with diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco), and six-minute walk test (6MWT). Subjects also quantified their dyspnoea and cough using a visual analogic scale (VAS) at three-time points: previously than COVID infection, during COVID hospitalization, and currently. The 76 subjects with reliable ABG during the hospitalization were stratified in three groups according to their worst PaO2/FiO2 ratio (p/F): “mild”: p/F>300 (n = 38);“moderate”: 200<p/F<300 (n = 30), “severe” p/F < 200 (n = 20). Results: In this cohort, Covid-19 recovered subjects still reported significant residual dyspnoea at the visit time. The severe subjects group showed a lower Total Lung Capacity (TLC), a lower DLco, and a worse 6MWT performance. Conclusion: After Covid-19, respiratory and functional impairments may persist. These impairments seem to be more severe as much as minor was the patient worst p/F during hospitalization. These patients should receive a strict follow-up.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
ACE2 Is an Adjacent Element of Atherosclerosis and COVID-19 Pathogenesis,"COVID-19 is a highly contagious new infection caused by the single-stranded RNA Sars-CoV-2 virus. For the first time, this infection was recorded in December 2019 in the Chinese province of Wuhan. The virus presumably crossed the interspecies barrier and passed to humans from a bat. Initially, the disease was considered exclusively in the context of damage to the respiratory system, but it quickly became clear that the disease also entails serious consequences from various systems, including the cardiovascular system. Among these consequences are myocarditis, myocardial damage, subsequent heart failure, myocardial infarction, and Takotsubo syndrome. On the other hand, clinical data indicate that the presence of chronic diseases in a patient aggravates the course and outcome of coronavirus infection. In this context, the relationship between COVID-19 and atherosclerosis, a condition preceding cardiovascular disease and other disorders of the heart and blood vessels, is particularly interesting. The renin-angiotensin system is essential for the pathogenesis of both coronavirus disease and atherosclerosis. In particular, it has been shown that ACE2, an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, plays a key role in Sars-CoV-2 infection due to its receptor activity. It is noteworthy that this enzyme is important for the normal functioning of the cardiovascular system. Disruptions in its production and functioning can lead to various disorders, including atherosclerosis.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Heterogeneidad de criterios en el diagnóstico de bronquiolitis aguda en España(),"INTRODUCTION: Acute viral bronchiolitis (AB) is one of the most common respiratory diseases in infants. However, diagnostic criteria for AB are heterogeneous and not very well known. OBJECTIVE: To identify the diagnostic criteria for AB used by experts and clinical paediatricians in Spain. METHODS: Delphi study with Spanish AB experts, looking for the points of agreement about AB diagnosis. A subsequent cross-sectional study was conducted by means of an on-line questionnaire addressed to all Spanish paediatricians, reached through electronic mail messages sent by nine paediatric scientific societies. Descriptive and factorial analyses were carried out, looking for any association of diagnostic criteria with demographic or geographic variables, or with paediatric subspecialty. RESULTS: Agreement was reached by 40 experts in many issues (first episode of respiratory distress and high respiratory frequency, diagnosis in any season of the year, and usefulness of virus identification in making diagnosis), but opposite views were maintained on key characteristics such as the maximum age for diagnosis. The on-line questionnaire was completed by 1297 paediatricians. Their diagnostic criteria were heterogeneous and strongly associated with their paediatric sub-specialty. Their agreement with the Spanish expert consensus and with international standards was very poor. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic criteria for AB in Spain are heterogeneous. These differences could cause variability in clinical practice with AB patients.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
ERAP2 Is Associated With Immune Infiltration and Predicts Favorable Prognosis in SqCLC,"BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy has been proven effective among several human cancer types, including Squamous cell lung carcinoma (SqCLC). ERAP2 plays a pivotal role in peptide trimming of many immunological processes. However, the prognostic role of ERAP2 and its relationship with immune cell infiltration in SqCLC remains unclear. METHODS: The differential expression of ERAP2 was identified via GEO and TCGA databases. We calculated the impact of ERAP2 on clinical prognosis using the Kaplan-Meier plotter. TIMER was applied to evaluate the abundance of immune cells infiltration and immune markers. SqCLC tissue microarrays containing 190 patients were constructed, and we performed immunohistochemical staining for ERAP2, CD8, CD47, CD68, and PD-L1 to validate our findings in public data. RESULTS: In the GEO SqCLC database, ERAP2 was upregulated in patients with better survival (p=0.001). ERAP2 expression in SqCLC was significantly lower than that of matched normal samples (p<0.05) based on TCGA SqCLC data. Higher expression of ERAP2 was significantly associated with better survival in SqCLC patients from TCGA (p=0.007), KM-plotter (p=0.017), and our tissue microarrays (TMAs) (p=0.026). In univariate and multivariate Cox analysis of SqCLC TMAs, high ERAP2 expression was identified as an independent protective factor for SqCLC patients (Univariate Cox, HR=0.659, range 0.454-0.956, p<0.05. Multivariate Cox, HR=0.578, range 0.385-0.866, p<0.05). In TIMER, ERAP2 was positively correlated with several immune markers (CD274, p=1.27E-04; CD68, p=5.88E-08) and immune infiltrating cells (CD8(+) T cell, p=4.09E-03; NK cell, p=1.00E-04). In our cohort, ERAP2 was significantly correlated with CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) (p=0.0029), and patients with higher ERAP2 expression had a higher percentage of PD-L1 positive patients (p=0.049) and a higher CD8(+) TILs level (p=0.036). CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, our study demonstrates that higher expression of ERAP2 is tightly associated with the immuno-supportive microenvironment and can predict a favorable prognosis in SqCLC. Meanwhile, ERAP2 may be a promising immunotherapeutic target for patients with SqCLC.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Virological and Immunological Outcomes of Coinfections.,"Coinfections involving viruses are being recognized to influence the disease pattern that occurs relative to that with single infection. Classically, we usually think of a clinical syndrome as the consequence of infection by a single virus that is isolated from clinical specimens. However, this biased laboratory approach omits detection of additional agents that could be contributing to the clinical outcome, including novel agents not usually considered pathogens. The presence of an additional agent may also interfere with the targeted isolation of a known virus. Viral interference, a phenomenon where one virus competitively suppresses replication of other coinfecting viruses, is the most common outcome of viral coinfections. In addition, coinfections can modulate virus virulence and cell death, thereby altering disease severity and epidemiology. Immunity to primary virus infection can also modulate immune responses to subsequent secondary infections. In this review, various virological mechanisms that determine viral persistence/exclusion during coinfections are discussed, and insights into the isolation/detection of multiple viruses are provided. We also discuss features of heterologous infections that impact the pattern of immune responsiveness that develops.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Iterative joint classifier and domain adaptation for visual transfer learning,"Current available supervised classifiers cannot generalize across various domains due to distribution mismatch among them. Domain adaptation and transfer learning algorithms are proposed to tackle domain shift problem that originates from different data collection conditions. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning framework called iterative joint classifier and domain adaptation for visual transfer learning (ICDAV), which utilizes the balanced maximum mean discrepancy to better transfer knowledge across domains. Also, for learning a robust classifier against domain shift, a set of graph manifold regularizer and modified joint probability maximum mean discrepancy are simultaneously exploited to capture the domain structures and adapt the distribution of projected samples during the model learning process. Variety of experiments on several public datasets indicates that our approach achieves remarkable performance on visual domain adaptation and transfer learning tasks.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Maintaining mask momentum in transplant recipients,"The widespread use of facemasks has been a crucial element in the control of the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic. With mounting evidence for mask efficacy against respiratory infectious diseases and greater acceptability of this intervention, it is proposed that masking should continue after the pandemic has abated to protect some of our most vulnerable patients, recipients of stem cell and solid organ transplants. This may involve not only masking these high‐risk patients, but possibly their close contacts and the healthcare workers involved in their care. We review the evidence for mask efficacy in prevention of respiratory viruses other than SARS‐CoV‐2 and address the burden of disease in transplant recipients. Although we acknowledge that there are limited data on masking to prevent infection in transplant recipients, we propose a framework for the study and implementation of routine masking as a part of infection prevention interventions after transplantation.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
The COVID-19 Pandemic Has Had Negative Effects on Baseline Clinical Presentation and Outcomes of Patients with Newly Diagnosed Treatment-Naïve Exudative AMD,"Purpose: To investigate whether the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-associated postponement in care had effects on the baseline clinical presentation of patients with newly diagnosed treatment-naïve exudative neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods: We included the first 50 consecutive patients referred within the COVID-19 pandemic with a diagnosis of treatment-naïve exudative neovascular AMD. Two groups of fifty consecutive patients with newly diagnosed neovascular exudative AMD presenting in 2018 and 2019 (control periods) were also included for comparisons. Results: Baseline visual acuity was statistically worse in patients referred during the COVID-19 pandemic period (0.87 ± 0.51 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR)) as compared with both the “2019” (0.67 ± 0.48 LogMAR, p = 0.001) and “2018” (0.69 ± 0.54 LogMAR, p = 0.012) control periods. Data on the visual function after a loading dose of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was available in a subset of patients (43 subjects in 2020, 45 in 2019 and 46 in 2018, respectively). Mean ± SD best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at the 1-month follow-up visit after the third anti-VEGF injection was still worse in patients referred during the COVID-19 pandemic (0.82 ± 0.66 LogMAR) as compared with both the “2019” (0.60 ± 0.45 LogMAR, p = 0.021) and “2018” (0.55 ± 0.53 LogMAR, p = 0.001) control periods. On structural optical coherence tomography (OCT), the maximum subretinal hyperreflective material (SHRM) height and width were significantly greater in the COVID-19 pandemic patients. Conclusions: We demonstrated that patients with newly diagnosed treatment-naïve exudative neovascular AMD referred during the COVID-19 pandemic had worse clinical characteristics at presentation and short-term visual outcomes.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
The Role of Magnetic Resonance Enterography in Crohn’s Disease: A Review of Recent Literature,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is the term used to identify a form of chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that primarily contemplates two major entities: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). The classic signs are abdominal pain and diarrhoea that correlate with the localization of gastro-enteric disease, although in this pathology extraintestinal symptoms may coexist. The diagnosis of CD relies on a synergistic combination of clinical, laboratory (stool and biochemical), cross-sectional imaging evaluation, as well as endoscopic and histologic assessments. The purpose of this paper is to prove the role of imaging in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with CD with particular focus on recent innovations of magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) as a pivotal diagnostic tool, analysing the MRE study protocol and imaging features during the various phases of disease activity and its complications.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Physics of the Inverted Harmonic Oscillator: From the lowest Landau level to event horizons,"In this work, we present the inverted harmonic oscillator (IHO) Hamiltonian as a paradigm to understand the quantum mechanics of scattering and time-decay in a diverse set of physical systems. As one of the generators of area preserving transformations, the IHO Hamiltonian can be studied as a dilatation generator, squeeze generator, a Lorentz boost generator, or a scattering potential. In establishing these different forms, we demonstrate the physics of the IHO that underlies phenomena as disparate as the Hawking-Unruh effect and scattering in the lowest Landau level(LLL) in quantum Hall systems. We derive the emergence of the IHO Hamiltonian in the LLL in a gauge invariant way and show its exact parallels with the Rindler Hamiltonian that describes quantum mechanics near event horizons. This approach of studying distinct physical systems with symmetries described by isomorphic Lie algebras through the emergent IHO Hamiltonian enables us to reinterpret geometric response in the lowest Landau level in terms of relativistic effects such as Wigner rotation. Further, the analytic scattering matrix of the IHO points to the existence of quasinormal modes (QNMs) in the spectrum, which have quantized time-decay rates. We present a way to access these QNMs through wave packet scattering, thus proposing a novel effect in quantum Hall point contact geometries that parallels those found in black holes.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Using in silico modelling and FRET-based assays in the discovery of novel FDA-approved drugs as inhibitors of MERS-CoV helicase,"A Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay was used to screen the FDA-approved compound library against the MERS-CoV helicase, an essential enzyme for virus replication within the host cell. Five compounds inhibited the helicase activity with submicromolar potencies (IC50, 0.73-1.65 µM) and ten compounds inhibited the enzyme with micromolar potencies (IC50, 19.6-502 µM). The molecular operating environment (MOE) was used to dock the identified inhibitors on the MERS-CoV helicase nucleotide binding. Strong inhibitors docked well in the nucleotide-binding site and established interactions with some of the essential residues. There was a reasonable correlation between the observed IC50 values and the MOE docking scores of the strong inhibitors (r 2 = 0.74), indicating the ability of the in silico docking model to predict the binding of strong inhibitors. In silico docking could be a useful complementary tool used with the FRET-based assay to predict new MERS-CoV helicase inhibitors. The identified inhibitors could potentially be used in the clinical development of new antiviral treatment for MERS-CoV and other coronavirus related diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

How to Sterilize Polylactic Acid Based Medical Devices?,"How sterilization techniques accurately affect the properties of biopolymers continues to be an issue of discussion in the field of biomedical engineering, particularly now with the development of 3D-printed devices. One of the most widely used biopolymers in the manufacture of biomedical devices is the polylactic acid (PLA). Despite the large number of studies found in the literature on PLA devices, relatively few papers focus on the effects of sterilization treatments on its properties. It is well documented in the literature that conventional sterilization techniques, such as heat, gamma irradiation and ethylene oxide, can induced damages, alterations or toxic products release, due to the thermal and hydrolytical sensitivity of PLA. The purposes of this paper are, therefore, to review the published data on the most common techniques used to sterilize PLA medical devices and to analyse how they are affecting their physicochemical and biocompatible properties. Emerging and alternative sterilization methods for sensitive biomaterials are also presented.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Extraction-free protocol combining proteinase K and heat inactivation for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR,"Real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is the gold-standard technique for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection in nasopharyngeal swabs specimens. The analysis by RT-qPCR usually requires a previous extraction step to obtain the purified viral RNA. Unfortunately, RNA extraction constitutes a bottleneck for early detection in many countries since it is expensive, time-consuming and depends on the availability of commercial kits. Here, we describe an extraction-free protocol for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR from nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples in saline solution. The method includes a treatment with proteinase K followed by heat inactivation (PK+HID method). We demonstrate that PK+HID improves the RT-qPCR performance in comparison to the heat-inactivation procedure. Moreover, we show that this extraction-free protocol can be combined with a variety of multiplexing RT-qPCR kits. The method combined with a multiplexing detection kit targeting N and ORF1ab viral genes showed a sensitivity of 0.99 and a specificity of 0.99 from the analysis of 106 positive and 106 negative clinical samples. In conclusion, PK+HID is a robust, fast and inexpensive procedure for extraction-free RT-qPCR determinations of SARS-CoV-2. The National Administration of Drugs, Foods and Medical Devices of Argentina has recently authorized the use of this method.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis in hemodialysis patients,"Background Coronavirus Disease 2019-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) is a fatal complication in the general population. However, there are few reports on CAPA in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). Methods This retrospective observational cohort study was conducted at a single center between December 2020 and June 2021. We enrolled 21 HD patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) undergoing treatment and divided them into two groups: CAPA and non-CAPA (COVID-19 with and without pulmonary aspergillosis);we evaluated their characteristics, clinical outcomes, and comorbidities. Results The log-rank test revealed that the 90-day survival rate after the initiation of treatment for COVID-19 was significantly lower in the CAPA (n = 6) than in the non-CAPA group (n = 15) (P = 0.0002), and the 90-day mortality rates were 66.6% and 0% in the CAPA and non-CAPA groups, respectively. In the CAPA group, four patients died due to respiratory failure (on days 6 and 20), gastrointestinal bleeding (day 8), and sepsis (day 33);the RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 remained positive when they died. The remaining two patients survived, and the negative conversion of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed on days 10 and 15. The negative conversion of serum (1, 3)-β-D-glucan (BDG) was confirmed on day 15 in one patient;the BDG remained positive on day 64 in the other. Conclusions CAPA is a fatal complication in HD patients and the general population. Therefore, clinicians should consider the possibility of testing for CAPA in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Mycological workups may be helpful for the early detection of CAPA.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Coronaviruses and the human airway: a universal system for virus-host interaction studies,"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are large RNA viruses that infect the human respiratory tract. The emergence of both Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory syndrome CoVs as well as the yearly circulation of four common CoVs highlights the importance of elucidating the different mechanisms employed by these viruses to evade the host immune response, determine their tropism and identify antiviral compounds. Various animal models have been established to investigate HCoV infection, including mice and non-human primates. To establish a link between the research conducted in animal models and humans, an organotypic human airway culture system, that recapitulates the human airway epithelium, has been developed. Currently, different cell culture systems are available to recapitulate the human airways, including the Air-Liquid Interface (ALI) human airway epithelium (HAE) model. Tracheobronchial HAE cultures recapitulate the primary entry point of human respiratory viruses while the alveolar model allows for elucidation of mechanisms involved in viral infection and pathogenesis in the alveoli. These organotypic human airway cultures represent a universal platform to study respiratory virus-host interaction by offering more detailed insights compared to cell lines. Additionally, the epidemic potential of this virus family highlights the need for both vaccines and antivirals.

Microbubble-enhanced ultrasound for the antivascular treatment and monitoring of hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Background and Objective: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver malignancy, and its current management relies heavily on locoregional therapy for curative therapy, bridge to transplant, and palliative therapy. Locoregional therapies include ablation and hepatic artery therapies such as embolization and radioembolization. In this study we evaluate the feasibility of using novel antivascular ultrasound (AVUS) as a noninvasive locoregional therapy to reduce perfusion in HCC lesions in a rat model and, monitor the effect with contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging. Methods: HCC was induced in 36 Wistar rats by the ingestion of 0.01% diethylnitrosamine (DEN) for 12 weeks. Two therapy regimens of AVUS were evaluated. A primary regimen (n = 19) utilized 2-W/cm2, 3-MHz ultrasound (US) for 6 minutes insonation with 0.7 ml of microbubbles administered as an intravenous bolus. An alternate dose at half the primary intensity, sonication time, and contrast concentration was evaluated in 11 rats to assess the efficacy of a reduced dose. A control group (n = 6) received a sham therapy. Tumor perfusion was measured before and after AVUS with nonlinear contrast ultrasound (NLC) and power Doppler (PD). The quantitative perfusion measures included perfusion index (PI), peak enhancement (PE), time to peak (TTP), and perfusion area from NLC and PD scans. Total tumor area perfused during the scan was measured by a postprocessing algorithm called delta projection. Tumor histology was evaluated for signs of tissue injury and for vascular changes using CD31 immunohistochemistry. Results: DEN exposure induced autochthonous hepatocellular carcinoma lesions in all rats. Across all groups prior to therapy, there were no significant differences in the nonlinear contrast observations of peak enhancement and perfusion index. In the control group, there were no significant differences in any of the parameters after sham treatment. After the primary AVUS regimen, there were significant changes in all parameters (p ≤ 0.05) indicating substantial decreases in tumor perfusion. Peak enhancement in nonlinear contrast scans showed a 37.9% ± 10.1% decrease in tumor perfusion. Following reduced-dose AVUS, there were no significant changes in perfusion parameters, although there was a trend for the nonlinear contrast observations of peak enhancement and perfusion index to increase. Conclusion: This study translated low-intensity AVUS therapy into a realistic in vivo model of HCC and evaluated its effects on the tumor vasculature. The primary dose of AVUS tested resulted in significant vascular disruption and a corresponding reduction in tumor perfusion. A reduced dose of AVUS, on the other hand, was ineffective at disrupting perfusion but demonstrated the potential for enhancing tumor blood flow. Theranostic ultrasound, where acoustic energy and microbubbles are used to monitor the tumor neovasculature as well as disrupt the vasculature and treat lesions, could serve as a potent tool for delivering noninvasive, locoregional therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Feasibility of a Health Coaching and Home-Based Rehabilitation Intervention With Remote Monitoring for COPD,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary rehabilitation is an effective treatment for patients with COPD, but patient uptake and adherence to the current offering of center-based pulmonary rehabilitation is modest due to transportation, access, poverty, and frailty, and even more so in the context of the COVID pandemic. Home-based options have been proposed and were found noninferior to center-based rehabilitation; however, there is a lack of home-based programs, and more understanding is needed. We aimed to test the feasibility, uptake, and adherence to a home-based program for COPD rehabilitation with health coaching. METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial with a wait-list controlled design to evaluate the effects of a home-based program with health coaching on breathlessness in subjects with moderate to severe COPD unable to attend the regular pulmonary rehabilitation program. The 8-week intervention consisted of video-guided exercises to be done 6 times a week and captured with a computer tablet. Health coaching was done weekly over the telephone to review subject activity and symptoms and to provide an opportunity for the subject to define their weekly goals. The primary outcomes were uptake, adherence, and Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) Dyspnea Domain. Secondary outcomes were self-management abilities and CRQ Emotions-Mastery-Fatigue. RESULTS: 154 subjects with moderate to severe COPD were randomized. Subject adherence was 86% to the proposed 6-times a week exercise routine. There (P = .062) was no significant difference in breathlessness (CRQ dyspnea). There was a significant improvement in self-management abilities (P < .001). The results of the qualitative interviews showed high levels of acceptability of the program. CONCLUSIONS: The tested home-based rehabilitation program with health coaching was feasible, highly acceptable, showed a high degree of adherence, and improved self-management abilities. This study offers seminal information for home-based rehabilitation programs to design alternative options of rehabilitation to individuals with COPD that cannot attend to the well-established center-based pulmonary rehabilitation.

Lymphangiosarcoma in two cats,"Lymphangiosarcoma is a malignant neoplasm of the lymphatic endothelium that is rare in cats. This report describes two cases of feline lymphangiosarcoma that originated in the distal limb, causing intractable lymphoedema and serosanguineous discharge with ecchymoses in local and distant sites. In association with the neoplasia, one cat had cortical bone lysis of multiple metacarpal bones of the affected limb and the other had severe immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA). The disease in both cases affected young cats and progressed rapidly. Persistent distal limb lymphoedema with serosanguineous discharge is suggestive of lymphangiosarcoma especially when local or distal ecchymoses are evident.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Effective protection of ZF2001 against the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in lethal K18-hACE2 mice,"To investigate the protective efficacy and mechanism of ZF2001 (a protein subunit vaccine with conditional approval in China) to SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant-induced severe pneumonia, the lethal challenge model of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice was used in this study. An inactivated-virus vaccine at the research and development stage (abbreviated as RDINA) was compared to ZF2001. We found that ZF2001 and RDINA could provide the protective effect against Delta variant-induced severe cases, as measured by the improved survival rates, the reduced virus loads, the alleviated lung histopathology and the high neutralizing antibody geomean titers, compared to aluminum adjuvant group. To prevent and control Omicron or other variant epidemics, further improvements in vaccine design and compatibilities with the novel adjuvant are required to achieve better immunogenicity.

Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic,"N95 respirators are personal protective equipment most often used to control exposures to infections transmitted via the airborne route. Supplies of N95 respirators can become depleted during pandemics or when otherwise in high demand. In this paper, we offer strategies for optimizing supplies of N95 respirators in health care settings while maximizing the level of protection offered to health care personnel when there is limited supply in the United States during the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic. The strategies are intended for use by professionals who manage respiratory protection programs, occupational health services, and infection prevention programs in health care facilities to protect health care personnel from job-related risks of exposure to infectious respiratory illnesses. Consultation with federal, state, and local public health officials is also important. We use the framework of surge capacity and the occupational health and safety hierarchy of controls approach to discuss specific engineering control, administrative control, and personal protective equipment measures that may help in optimizing N95 respirator supplies.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
MICROVASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL CELL ADAPTATION TO HYPOXIA IS ORGAN-SPECIFIC AND CONDITIONED BY ENVIRONMENTAL OXYGEN,"Microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) are plastic, versatile and highly responsive cells, with morphological and functional aspects that uniquely match the tissues they supply. The response of these cells to oxygen oscillations is an essential aspect of tissue homeostasis, and is finely tuned to maintain organ function during physiological and metabolic challenges. Primary MVEC from two continuous capillary networks with distinct organ microenvironments, those of the lung and brain, were pre-conditioned at normal atmospheric (∼ 21 %) and physiological (5 and 10 %) O2 levels, and subsequently used to compare organ-specific MVEC hypoxia response. Brain MVEC preferentially stabilise HIF-2α in response to hypoxia, whereas lung MVEC primarily accumulate HIF-1α; however, this does not result in significant differences at the level of transcriptional activation of hypoxia-induced genes. Glycolytic activity is comparable between brain and lung endothelial cells, and is affected by oxygen pre-conditioning, while glucose uptake is not changed by oxygen pre-conditioning and is observed to be consistently higher in brain MVEC. Conversely, MVEC mitochondrial activity is organ-specific; brain MVEC maintain a higher relative mitochondrial spare capacity at 5% O2, but not following hyperoxic priming. If maintained at supra-physiological O2 levels, both MVEC fail to respond to hypoxia, and have severely compromised and delayed induction of the glycolytic shifts required for survival, an effect which is particularly pronounced in brain MVEC. Oxygen preconditioning also differentially shapes the composition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) in the two MVEC populations. Lung MVEC primed at physioxia have lower levels of all ETC complexes compared to hyperoxia, an effect exacerbated by hypoxia. Conversely, brain MVEC expanded in physioxia display increased complex II (SDH) activity, which is further augmented during hypoxia. SDH activity in brain MVEC primed at 21 % O2 is ablated; upon hypoxia, this results in the accumulation of near-toxic levels of succinate in these cells. Our data suggests that, even though MVEC are primarily glycolytic, mitochondrial integrity in brain MVEC is essential for metabolic responses to hypoxia; these responses are compromised when cells are exposed to supra-physiological levels of oxygen. This work demonstrates that the study of MVEC in normal cell culture environments do not adequately represent physiological parameters found in situ, and show that the unique metabolism and function of organ-specific MVEC can be reprogrammed by external oxygen, significantly affecting the timing and degree of downstream responses. Graphical Abstract In brief Hypoxia sensing by microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) is organ-specific, and efficacy of response is affected by external oxygen. While glycolytic capacity is mostly maintained in MVEC regardless of organ or origin, mitochondrial function is required for adequate sensing and timely metabolic shift to glycolysis. Hyperoxygenation of MVEC compromises mitochondrial function, glycolytic shift and survival to hypoxia. Highlights Environmental O2 influences MVEC hypoxia response in an organ-specific fashion Brain MVEC are unable to respond and survive to hypoxia if hyperoxygenated prior to stress MVEC glycolytic capacity is not affected by O2, but the increase in glucose uptake and shift to glycolytic metabolism stifled and delayed in hyperoxidized MVEC High O2 ablates activity of mitochondria complex II in brain MVEC, significantly disturbing succinate levels Disruption of mitochondrial integrity compromises hypoxia sensing irrespective of glycolytic capacity",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Analyzing the Characteristics of Green Bond Markets to Facilitate Green Finance in the Post-COVID-19 World,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the global recessions have reduced the investments in green projects globally that would endanger the achievement of the climate-related goals Therefore, the post-COVID-19 world needs to adopt the green financial system by introducing new financial instruments In this regard, green bonds—a type of debt instrument aiming to finance sustainable infrastructure projects—are growing in popularity While the literature does not contest their effectiveness in fighting climate change, research highlights the high level of risks and low returns associated with this instrument This study analyzes the green bond markets in different regions with a focus on Asia and the Pacific It aims to fill the gap in the literature by conducting a comparative study of the characteristics, risks, and returns of green bonds based on the region The study is based on theoretical background and empirical analysis using the data retrieved from Bloomberg New Energy Finance and the Climate Bonds Initiative The empirical results are based on several econometrics tests using panel data analysis estimation methods, namely pooled ordinary least squares and generalized least squares random effects estimator Our findings prove that green bonds in Asia tend to show higher returns but higher risks and higher heterogeneity Generally, the Asian green bonds market is dominated by the banking sector, representing 60% of all issuance Given that bonds issued by this sector tend to show lower returns than average, we recommend policies that could increase the rate of return of bonds issued by the banking sector through the use of tax spillover In the era of post-COVID-19, diversification of issuers, with higher participation from the public sector and de-risking policies, could also be considered",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Clinical characteristics and mortality associated with COVID-19 at high altitude: a cohort of 5161 patients in Bogotá, Colombia","BACKGROUND: There are few data on the clinical outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in cities over 1000 m above sea level (masl). OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical characteristics and mortality of patients with COVID-19 treated at a high complexity hospital in Bogotá, Colombia, at 2640 masl. METHODS: This was an observational study of a cohort including 5161 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from 19 March 2020 to 30 April 2021. Demographic data, laboratory values, comorbidities, oxygenation indices, and clinical outcomes were collected. Data were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. An independent predictive model was performed for mortality and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) using classification and regression trees (CART). RESULTS: The median cohort age was 66 years (interquartile range (IQR) 53–77), with 1305 patients dying (25%) and 3856 surviving (75%). The intensive care unit (ICU) received 1223 patients (24%). Of 898 patients who received IMV, 613 (68%) of them perished. The ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen (PaO(2)) to fraction inspired oxygen (FiO(2)), or the P/F ratio, upon ICU admission was 105 (IQR 77–146) and 137 (IQR 91–199) in the deceased and survivors, respectively. The CART model showed that the need for IMV, age greater than 79 years, ratio of oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) to FiO(2), or the S/F ratio, less than 259, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) greater than 617 U/L at admission were associated with a greater probability of death. CONCLUSION: Among more than 5000 patients with COVID-19 treated in our hospital, mortality at hospital discharge was 25%. Older age, low S/F ratio, and high LDH at admission were predictors of mortality.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Statistical modeling of the novel COVID-19 epidemic in Iraq,"This study aimed to apply three of the most important nonlinear growth models (Gompertz, Richards, and Weibull) to study the daily cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in Iraq during the period from 13th of March, 2020 to 22nd of July, 2020.Using the nonlinear least squares method, the three growth models were estimated in addition to calculating some related measures in this study using the “nonlinear regression” tool available in Minitab-17, and the initial values of the parameters were deduced from the transformation to the simple linear regression equation. Comparison of these models was made using some statistics (F-test, AIC, BIC, AICc and WIC).The results indicate that the Weibull model is the best adequate model for studying the cumulative daily number of COVID-19 cases in Iraq according to some criteria such as having the highest F and lowest values for RMSE, bias, MAE, AIC, BIC, AICc and WIC with no any violations of the assumptions for the model’s residuals (independent, normal distribution and homogeneity variance). The overall model test and tests of the estimated parameters showed that the Weibull model was statistically significant for describing the study data.From the Weibull model predictions, the number of cumulative confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in Iraq will increase by a range of 101,396 (95% PI: 99,989 to 102,923) to 114,907 (95% PI: 112,251 to 117,566) in the next 24 days (23rd of July to 15th of August 15, 2020). From the inflection points in the Weibull curve, the peak date when the growth rate will be maximum, is 7th of July, 2020, and at this time the daily cumulative cases become 67,338. Using the nonlinear least squares method, the models were estimated and some related measures were calculated in this study using the “nonlinear regression” tool available in Minitab-17, and the initial values of the parameters were obtained from the transformation to the simple linear regression model.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
A single- center experience of prolactin-producing pituitary adenomas without hyperprolactinemia: Its incidence and clinical management.,"OBJECTIVE This study clarifies the incidence of prolactin-producing pituitary adenomas without hyperprolactinemia and determines the appropriate treatment strategy for these tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS This retrospective analysis focused on prolactin-producing adenomas without hyperprolactinemia, which were initially treated by surgery as nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. Among 942 patients with histologically confirmed pituitary adenoma, 114 (12.1 %) patients, consisting of 68 men and 46 women, who had prolactin-producing adenomas without hyperprolactinemia were identified between April 2005 and March 2019. RESULTS Of the 114 patients identified, 13 (11.4 %) had prolactin mono-expressions, 18 (15.8 %) had pit-1 lineage hormonal expressions, and 83 (72.8 %) had paradoxical immunoexpression out of the pituitary differentiation lineage, including prolactin. During the follow-up period, 19 patients suffered tumor progression, and 14 required salvage treatment. Of the 19 patients, 11 underwent gamma knife radiosurgery, and none of them experienced further tumor progression. Cabergoline was administered of them to six patients, and one achieved tumor shrinkage. However, the remaining five patients who were treated with cabergoline suffered further tumor progression and required another salvage treatment. Among the patients in the prolactin mono-expression group, one experienced tumor regrowth and underwent gamma knife radiosurgery. In the pit-1 lineage group, two patients experienced tumor regrowth. One had further tumor progression after treatment with cabergoline and underwent gamma knife radiosurgery. Among the patients in the paradoxical immunoexpression group, 16 suffered tumor progression. Four patients underwent further surgery, seven patients were treated with gamma knife radiosurgery, and one patient received fractionated irradiation. None of the eight patients who were treated with gamma knife radiosurgery and fractionated irradiation showed further tumor progression. Four patients in this group were treated with cabergoline, but they all suffered further tumor progression and underwent additional salvage treatments. CONCLUSIONS Out of the pituitary differentiation lineage, paradoxical hormonal expression occurred in three-quarters of the patients identified. Further surgery or gamma knife radiosurgery should be given priority in times of tumor progression because most patients were resistant to dopamine agonists.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Changes in emergency patient presentation to a maxillofacial surgery department during the COVID-19 pandemic,"PURPOSE: To examine possible changes in the emergency patient volume and reasons for presentation to an oral and maxillofacial surgery department during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the resulting contact prohibitions. We hypothesized that the pandemic would lead to fewer patients presenting with emergent conditions. METHODS: A total of 939 patients, who presented to the Department for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of Hannover Medical School during the first 4 weeks of contact prohibitions in Germany, starting from March 23, 2020 until April 19, 2020, and in comparable periods were examined. The number of patients, reason for presentation, and required treatments were documented and compared to the years 2018 and 2019. Special attention was paid to the changes in trauma cases. RESULTS: We found that the number of patients in 2020 was significantly lower (p((2019)) < 0.001, p((2018)) < 0.01), but sex and age distributions were comparable to those in the previous years. Both the absolute and relative frequencies of dental diagnoses were significantly lower in 2020 (p((2019)) < 0.001, p((2018)) < 0.001), while the proportion of patients who presented with trauma was significantly higher (p((2019)) < 0.001, p((2018)) < 0.001). A significant decrease in patient number to the hospital, despite private practices being closed, was presumably due to patients' infection-related concerns. Trauma cases were more frequent in private settings, and traumatic events under the influence of alcohol were frequent. The circumstances and not the absolute number of trauma events had changed. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has important effects on the use of emergency services concerning oral and maxillofacial surgery in Germany.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Comparison of the Medical Burden of COVID-19 with Seasonal Influenza and Measles Outbreaks,"AIM: To examine and compare the medical burden of measles, influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks in the city of Bnei Brak, Israel. METHODS: The study was conducted during 2018-2021. The numbers of hospitalisations for these infections, their complications were recorded. Hospitalisation rates were determined by using the number of children residing in Bnei Brak and hospitalised with these infections during the study period as the numerators. The denominators were the estimated pediatric cases of measles, influenza and COVID-19 in Bnei Brak and were calculated under both: pragmatic and conservative assumptions. RESULTS: A total of 247, 65 and 32 children were hospitalised with influenza, COVID-19 and measles, respectively. Complications rates were higher following measles than after influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Hospitalisation rates were 10% for measles, 0.6%-1.2% for influenza, and 0.15% - 0.25% for COVID-19 infections. Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for hospitalisation following measles compared to COVID-19 ranged from 42 (26.3-67.3), to 70.1 (43.8-112.1), while the relative risks for influenza hospitalization ranged from 2.5 (1.83 - 3.41) to 8.2 (6.0-11.2), compared to COVID 19 infection.

COVID-19 and its Impact on Education of Preschool Students in a Developing Nation: A Viewpoint,"The pandemic of COVID-19 has played havoc on the economy, healthcare, and education facilities of the world. Many new modes of work have been adopted as a precaution against this deadly disease, and many guidelines have been formed, like using masks in public, maintaining social distance, and restricting movements. These precautions are helpful for prevention but, at the same time, they have put a significant mental burden for the school-going children who were used to the routine school activities with their friends and teachers. The pre-school children, or children belonging to the class of early childhood education as it is often interchangeably called, in a developing country are adversely affected in this pandemic either due to lack of awareness about online mode of teaching and learning and lack of interactions with their peers and teachers or their limited technical support.

Molecular Identification of Infectious Enteropathogens in Faeces of Healthy Horses,"Zoogenic faecal contamination of the environment is one of the indices included in the evaluation of ecological threats, health hazards and adverse impacts on various ecosystems. The risks and environmental concerns are associated with the fact that faeces of wild and domesticated animals constitute the largest source of environmental loading of enteropathogens associated with transmission of zoonotic diseases (enteric zoonoses). Although sick animals are more likely to transmit pathogens, healthy ones can also be the carriers and defecate them into the environment. This is of particular importance given the close human-animal interactions and health effects resulting from human and ecological exposures to faecal hazards from companion and farm animals. We have therefore set out to investigate whether healthy equines can carry and defecate human infectious pathogens. For this purpose, we set up a pilot study to examine the faecal DNA of horses using culture-independent molecular diagnostics - fluorescent probe-based quantitative real-time PCR. Our results revealed that among a total of 23 horses, 6 were found to carry Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni), and 5 had Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium). Moreover, Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) was found in 14 horses, while 19 were positive for Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens). Furthermore, the frequently reported protozoan parasites in livestock, Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) and Giardia lamblia (G. lamblia), were discovered in 8 and 7 samples, respectively. This pilot study shed new light on the phenomenon of healthy horses carrying C. jejuni and other human-health-related enteropathogens.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

A shift towards using superficial absorbable sutures (AS) has been anecdotally observed. We explored patient attitudes to the use of AS, and their experiences and perceptions of attending for skin surgery during the pandemic. In total, 35 participants were interviewed (74% men, 100% white British; mean age 72.5 years, range 43-95 years). Participants reported that they were reassured by precautions taken to minimize exposure and risk from COVID-19. The majority (86%) did not feel that personal protective equipment worn by staff impaired their experience, and 29% reported that their experience of attending for skin surgery during the lockdown period was more efficient and organized than on prepandemic visits. The vast majority (94%) of participants would opt to have AS again or had no strong preference for either suture type.

Association of Salivary Content Alteration and Early Ageusia Symptoms in COVID-19 Infections: A Systemic Review,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a major threat to the health and prosperity of human life at present. It has resulted in loss of thousands of lives globally and has brought countries to the brink of economic, social, and health collapse. A major issue of this infection is the ease with which it transmits through salivary droplets and its survival for long durations outside the body. Therefore, its early detection is critical in prevention, diagnostic, and management efforts of COVID-19 patients. Loss of taste and smell is one of the early symptoms reported in these patients and the virus is abundantly found in the salivary secretion of the infected symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Infection and inflammation of salivary glands are common among viral infections, particularly in the early stages, which lead to salivary composition changes. Chemosensory sensation of taste is critically dependent on the salivary flow rate and its inorganic constituents, protein levels, specific 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate and 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels, ghrelins, pH levels, and enzymes. Therefore, the question arises, ""Does COVID-19 infection alter the salivary components and composition leading to early transient symptoms of Ageusia and hypogeusia?"" This review shows association of the COVID-19 and Ageusia, in addition to the early viral infection of salivary glands and possible changes in salivary flow and content. Therefore, suggesting a potential association between early ageusia in COVID-19 infection and salivary compositional changes.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Spleen Contraction During Sudden Eupneic Hypoxia Elevates Hemoglobin Concentration,"The spleen contracts progressively during moderate normobaric hypoxia exposure of 20 min, which elevates hemoglobin concentration (Hb). However, acute hypoxia exposure could be shorter and more severe when oxygen systems fail during, e.g., high-altitude sky diving, aircraft cabin pressure drop, balloon flights, extreme altitude climbing, and in some maladies. We aimed to evaluate the speed and magnitude of spleen contraction during short exposure to extreme eupneic hypoxia and its subsequent recovery on oxygen. Eight female and seven male volunteers were exposed to normobaric hypoxia (10% oxygen) for 10 min during sitting rest, followed by 10 min on 100% oxygen. Heart rate (HR), arterial oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) were measured continuously. The spleen was measured via ultrasonic imaging every minute for volume calculations, and venous blood samples were drawn before and after exposure for hemoglobin concentration (Hb). Mean (SD) spleen volume was 279 (115) mL before exposure, 219 (75) mL (21% reduction; P = 0.005) at 3 min of exposure, and 201 (93) mL after 10 min exposure to hypoxia (28% reduction; P < 0.001). Hb was 138.8 (7.6) g·L(−1) before and 142.9 (8.1) g·L(−1) after 10 min of exposure (2.9% increase; P < 0.001). SpO(2) was 96.4 (1.7)% before exposure and 74.7 (8.4)% during the last minute of exposure (22.5% reduction; P < 0.001). HR increased from 80 (14) to 90 (17) bpm during exposure (12% increase, P < 0.05). MAP remained unchanged. After 10 min recovery on oxygen, values had been restored for spleen volume and Hb, while SpO(2) was higher and HR lower compared with before hypoxia exposure. We concluded that acute normobaric hypoxia of only 10 min caused significant spleen volume contraction with Hb increase. This rapid spleen response, evident already after 3 min of exposure, could have a protective effect during sudden exposure to severe hypoxia.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Genome-wide CRISPR screens identify GATA6 as a proviral host factor for SARS-CoV-2 via modulation of ACE2,"The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 led to major economic and health challenges worldwide. Revealing host genes essential for infection by multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 can provide insights into the virus pathogenesis, and facilitate the development of novel therapeutics. Here, employing a genome-scale CRISPR screen, we provide a comprehensive data-set of cellular factors that are exploited by wild type SARS-CoV-2 as well as two additional recently emerged variants of concerns (VOCs), Alpha and Beta. We identified several host factors critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including various components belonging to the Clathrin-dependent transport pathway, ubiquitination, Heparan sulfate biogenesis and host phosphatidylglycerol biosynthesis. Comparative analysis of the different VOCs revealed the host factors KREMEN2 and SETDB1 as potential unique candidates required only to the Alpha variant. Furthermore, the analysis identified GATA6, a zinc finger transcription factor, as an essential proviral gene for all variants inspected. We show that GATA6 directly regulates ACE2 transcription and accordingly, is critical for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Analysis of clinical samples collected from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals shows elevated levels of GATA6, suggesting a role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of GATA6 resulted in down-modulation of ACE2 and inhibition of viral infectivity. Overall, we show GATA6 may represent a target for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic strategies and reaffirm the value of the CRISPR loss-of-function screens in providing a list of potential new targets for therapeutic interventions.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Increased Self-medication with Steroids in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients during COVID-19 Pandemic: Time to Optimize Specialized Telemonitoring Services,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a serious condition characterized by a complex interaction of genetic, environmental, and inflammatory variables that affect the gut and other extragastrointestinal systems. Self-medication with steroids has become a major issue in light of the current pandemic situation in IBD patients. We observed a higher frequency of steroid self-medication (17.9%) and steroid overprescription (28.2%) by non-gastroenterologists during the pandemic. The use of telemonitoring tools can improve patient-IBD care provider communications in terms of drug compliance and better disease outcomes. How to cite this article: Vinay G.

Women Tell All: A Comparative Thematic Analysis of Women’s Perspectives on Two Brief Counseling Interventions for Intimate Partner Violence,"Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health problem that is commonly experienced by women and associated with psychosocial health issues. Recovering from IPV through Strengths and Empowerment (RISE) is a brief, clinician-administered, variable-length (1–6 sessions), modular, individualized psychosocial counseling intervention developed for women experiencing IPV. We present qualitative feedback and quantitative helpfulness ratings from women patients of the Veterans Health Administration who completed a randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing RISE to a clinician-administered advocacy-based Enhanced Care as Usual (ECAU; a single structured session consisting of psychoeducation, safety-planning, resources, and referrals). Methods: 58 participants ((M)age = 39.21) completed post-intervention semi-structured qualitative interviews, including helpfulness ratings, at two follow-up assessments (10- and 14-weeks post-enrollment) to assess the acceptability, usefulness, and perceived fit of the interventions for women’s needs. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using a hybrid deductive-inductive analytic approach. Results: While both the RISE and ECAU interventions were deemed helpful (interventions were rated as ‘highly helpful’ by 77% of RISE and 52% of ECAU participants), differences were identified in perceived impacts of the intervention, application of content, approach to patient-centeredness, and implementation recommendations. Conclusions: Findings shed light on women Veterans’ experiences and preferences for IPV psychosocial counseling interventions. Such knowledge can inform evidence-based, trauma-informed, and individualized care for women Veterans who experience IPV and may have relevance to other populations of women who experience IPV.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Visual Experience Influences Dendritic Orientation but Is Not Required for Asymmetric Wiring of the Retinal Direction Selective Circuit,"Changes in dendritic morphology in response to activity have long been thought to be a critical component of how neural circuits develop to properly encode sensory information. Ventral-preferring direction-selective ganglion cells (vDSGCs) have asymmetric dendrites oriented along their preferred direction, and this has been hypothesized to play a critical role in their tuning. Here we report the surprising result that visual experience is critical for the alignment of vDSGC dendrites to their preferred direction. Interestingly, vDSGCs in dark-reared mice lose their inhibition-independent dendritic contribution to direction-selective tuning while maintaining asymmetric inhibitory input. These data indicate that different mechanisms of a cell's computational abilities can be constructed over development through divergent mechanisms.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Significance of liver dysfunction associated with decreased hepatic CT attenuation values in Japanese patients with severe COVID-19,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has emerged as a threat to human health. Liver dysfunction has been reported to occur frequently in patients with COVID-19, although its significance has not yet been elucidated. METHODS: The subjects were 35 patients with COVID-19, and clinical characteristics were retrospectively analyzed. COVID-19 patients requiring ventilator were classified as having severe COVID-19. RESULTS: All 35 patients were diagnosed as having mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at admission, but the severity aggravated to severe in 8 patients (22.9%) in hospital. Hepatocellular-type liver injury, defined as elevation of the serum AST and/or ALT levels to ≥ 3 times the ULN, was seen in 2 patients (5.7%), and cholestasis-type liver injury, defined as elevation of the serum ALP, γ-GTP and/or total bilirubin levels to ≥ twice the ULN, was seen in 4 patients (11.4%). A total of 9 patients (25.7%) fulfilled the criteria for liver injury. The percentage of patients with liver injury was higher in patients with severe COVID-19 than in the remaining patients (P = 0.001). Both the hepatic CT attenuation values and the liver-to-spleen attenuation (L/S) ratios at admission were lower in the former patients than in the latter patients (P < 0.001). ROC curve revealed the optimal cut-off value of the L/S ratio of 1.03 for discriminating between patients with severe and non-severe diseases. The hepatic CT attenuation values increased at the remission phase of the disease as compared to the values at admission (P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: Liver dysfunction associated with reduced hepatic CT attenuation values correlated with the disease severity in patients with COVID-19.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Recommendations for dermatologists treating patients with atopic dermatitis during the Covid-19 pandemic: a look into the past for a conscious vaccination management,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects approximately 20% of children and 10% of adults. The implication of vaccines as a trigger for the de novo onset of AD in children or as a cause of exacerbation in individuals with a history of AD has long been debated. We present a brief review of the literature on AD and traditional vaccinations, proposing in addition the main recommendations for the management of patients with AD undergoing the vaccine against the SARS-COV-2 virus. Live attenuated vaccines seem to be associated with a relapse of AD and/or complications, such as eczema vaccinatum. For non-live vaccines, no adverse events are noted in atopic subjects. Since the Covid-19 vaccine is mRNA or viral vectored vaccine and there are no other currently used vaccines of this type, the same recommendations are applied as for all other non-live vaccines.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Direct contact between Plasmodium falciparum and human B-cells in a novel co-culture increases parasite growth and affects B-cell growth,"BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum parasites cause malaria and co-exist in humans together with B-cells for long periods of time. Immunity is only achieved after repeated exposure. There has been a lack of methods to mimic the in vivo co-occurrence, where cells and parasites can be grown together for many days, and it has been difficult with long time in vitro studies. METHODS AND RESULTS: A new method for growing P. falciparum in 5% CO(2) with a specially formulated culture medium is described. This knowledge was used to establish the co-culture of live P. falciparum together with human B-cells in vitro for 10 days. The presence of B-cells clearly enhanced parasite growth, but less so when Transwell inserts were used (not allowing passage of cells or merozoites), showing that direct contact is advantageous. B-cells also proliferated more in presence of parasites. Symbiotic parasitic growth was verified using CESS cell-line and it showed similar results, indicating that B-cells are indeed the cells responsible for the effect. In malaria endemic areas, people often have increased levels of atypical memory B-cells in the blood, and in this assay it was demonstrated that when parasites were present there was an increase in the proportion of CD19 + CD20 + CD27 − FCRL4 + B-cells, and a contraction of classical memory B-cells. This effect was most clearly seen when direct contact between B-cells and parasites was allowed. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that P. falciparum and B-cells undoubtedly can affect each other when allowed to multiply together, which is valuable information for future vaccine studies.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Chloroquine against malaria, cancers and viral diseases","Quinoline (QN) derivatives are often used for the prophylaxis and treatment of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ), a protonated, weakly basic drug, exerts its antimalarial effect mainly by increasing pH and accumulating in the food vacuole of the parasites. Repurposing CQ is an emerging strategy for new indications. Given the inhibition of autophagy and its immunomodulatory action, CQ shows positive efficacy against cancer and viral diseases, include Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we review the underlying mechanisms behind the antimalarial, anticancer and antiviral effects of CQ. We also discuss the clinical evidence for the use of CQ and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) against COVID-19.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Oil and Gas Pipeline Monitoring during COVID-19 Pandemic via Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,"The vast network of oil and gas transmission pipelines requires periodic monitoring for maintenance and hazard inspection to avoid equipment failure and potential accidents. The severe COVID-19 pandemic situation forced the companies to shrink the size of their teams. One risk which is faced on-site is represented by the uncontrolled release of flammable oil and gas. Among many inspection methods, the unmanned aerial vehicle system contains flexibility and stability. Unmanned aerial vehicles can transfer data in real-time, while they are doing their monitoring tasks. The current article focuses on unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with optical sensing and artificial intelligence, especially image recognition with deep learning techniques for pipeline surveillance. Unmanned aerial vehicles can be used for regular patrolling duties to identify and capture images and videos of the area of interest. Places that are hard to reach will be accessed faster, cheaper and with less risk. The current paper is based on the idea of capturing video and images of drone-based inspections, which can discover several potential hazardous problems before they become dangerous. Damage can emerge as a weakening of the cladding on the external pipe insulation. There can also be the case when the thickness of piping through external corrosion can occur. The paper describes a survey completed by experts from the oil and gas industry done for finding the functional and non-functional requirements of the proposed system.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Establishment of telemedicine for COVID-19 affected patients at home isolation in a secondary care hospital in the context of COVID-19 pandemic,"AimEstablishment of telemedicine for COVID-19 affected patients at home isolation in a secondary care hospital in the context of COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsWhile I was volunteering for the national telemedicine support for COVID-19 patients, a thoughtful implementation of the same in our hospital to help home isolated COVID-19 patients was made by our team. After seeking permission from the management, circulars were dispersed by means of hard copies and digital pamphlets to the employees’ homes. We trained doctors in standard operating protocol, ethics and legalities of telemedicine and COVID-19 home isolation guidelines. Apart from these periodic meetings held to address the problems, regular feedback from doctors and the patients noted, COVID-19 case audits conducted, a nodal officer assigned for liaising between the hospital, patients and for primary contact tracing. All the tele-consulted patients information documented were updated to the local government bodies.ResultsThe whole process nurtured young leaders in the unprecedented times aiding the leadership to break barriers and adapt to function efficiently. Telemedicine transformed the patient-doctor relationship helping to build good rapport, became an efficient way of treatment and the patients accepted telemedicine as it was safe for their families.ConclusionA leader’s role in the healthcare system is to empower innovative solutions by fostering interaction and aiding quality patient care. We used the COVID-19 pandemic to transform a secondary care hospital into a more resilient system. Telemedicine was a ray of hope for distorted patients, challenged the perception of the existing practicing methods and skills.

Cognitive Function and Neuropsychiatric Disorders after COVID-19: A Long Term Social and Clinical Problem?,"SARS-CoV-2 is one more virus that can affect the brain in one way or another. Now, we are only beginning to understand some mechanisms and the degree to which it can impact the nervous system. Considering the rapid accumulation of knowledge about multiple neurological and cognitive symptoms in COVID-19 patients, it seems useful to encourage the development of systematic approaches for the diagnosis, management and treatment of the cognitive aspects of COVID-19. From what is known at this time about the impact of COVID-19 on the brain, the presentation of long-term cognitive sequelae can be expected to be heterogeneous in nature and will depend at least in part on the severity of the disease at the stage acute COVID-19. The long-term essential characteristics of these sequelae will probably be related to a combination of causes and different neuropathological processes in the acute phase. The scope and severity of the current COVID-19 pandemic are unparalleled in modern society. The later implications for neurological function can be just as serious. Although the current focus is on the management of acute diseases, in the near future the focus should be on the long-term consequences of COVID-19 infection and its mitigation, hence the need for the development of systematic approaches for the management of the cognitive and neuropsychiatric aspects of COVID-19.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Universal Flu mRNA Vaccine: Promises, Prospects, and Problems","The seasonal flu vaccine is, essentially, the only known way to prevent influenza epidemics. However, this approach has limited efficacy due to the high diversity of influenza viruses. Several techniques could potentially overcome this obstacle. A recent first-in-human study of a chimeric hemagglutinin-based universal influenza virus vaccine demonstrated promising results. The coronavirus pandemic triggered the development of fundamentally new vaccine platforms that have demonstrated their effectiveness in humans. Currently, there are around a dozen messenger RNA and self-amplifying RNA flu vaccines in clinical or preclinical trials. However, the applicability of novel approaches for a universal influenza vaccine creation remains unclear. The current review aims to cover the current state of this problem and to suggest future directions for RNA-based flu vaccine development.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Supervised consumption site enables cost savings by avoiding emergency services: a cost analysis study,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We report on a cost analysis study, using population level data to determine the emergency service costs avoided from emergency overdose management at supervised consumption services (SCS). DESIGN: We completed a cost analysis from a payer’s perspective. In this setting, there is a single-payer model of service delivery. SETTING: In Calgary, Canada, ‘Safeworks Harm Reduction Program’ was established in late 2017 and offers 24/7 access to SCS. The facility is a nurse-led service, available for client drop-in. We conducted a cost analysis for the entire duration of the program from November 2017 to January 2020, a period of 2 years and 3 months. METHODS: We assessed costs using the following factors from government health databases: monthly operational costs of providing services for drug consumption, cost of providing ambulance pre-hospital care for clients with overdoses who could not be revived at the facility, cost of initial treatment in an emergency department, and benefit of costs averted from overdoses that were successfully managed at the SCS. RESULTS: The proportion of clients who have overdosed at the SCS has decreased steadily for the duration of the program. The number of overdoses that can be managed on site at the SCS has trended upward, currently 98%. Each overdose that is managed at the SCS produces approximately $1600 CAD in cost savings, with a savings of over $2.3 million for the lifetime of the program. CONCLUSION: Overdose management at an SCS creates cost savings by offsetting costs required for managing overdoses using emergency department and pre-hospital ambulance services.

Managing COVID-19 within and across health systems: why we need performance intelligence to coordinate a global response,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is a complex global public health crisis presenting clinical, organisational and system-wide challenges. Different research perspectives on health are needed in order to manage and monitor this crisis. Performance intelligence is an approach that emphasises the need for different research perspectives in supporting health systems’ decision-makers to determine policies based on well-informed choices. In this paper, we present the viewpoint of the Innovative Training Network for Healthcare Performance Intelligence Professionals (HealthPros) on how performance intelligence can be used during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: A lack of standardised information, paired with limited discussion and alignment between countries contribute to uncertainty in decision-making in all countries. Consequently, a plethora of different non-data-driven and uncoordinated approaches to address the outbreak are noted worldwide. Comparative health system research is needed to help countries shape their response models in social care, public health, primary care, hospital care and long-term care through the different phases of the pandemic. There is a need in each phase to compare context-specific bundles of measures where the impact on health outcomes can be modelled using targeted data and advanced statistical methods. Performance intelligence can be pursued to compare data, construct indicators and identify optimal strategies. Embracing a system perspective will allow countries to take coordinated strategic decisions while mitigating the risk of system collapse.A framework for the development and implementation of performance intelligence has been outlined by the HealthPros Network and is of pertinence. Health systems need better and more timely data to govern through a pandemic-induced transition period where tensions between care needs, demand and capacity are exceptionally high worldwide. Health systems are challenged to ensure essential levels of healthcare towards all patients, including those who need routine assistance. CONCLUSION: Performance intelligence plays an essential role as part of a broader public health strategy in guiding the decisions of health system actors on the implementation of contextualised measures to tackle COVID-19 or any future epidemic as well as their effect on the health system at large. This should be based on commonly agreed-upon standardised data and fit-for-purpose indicators, making optimal use of existing health information infrastructures. The HealthPros Network can make a meaningful contribution.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Video Laryngoscope versus USB borescope aided endotracheal intubation in adults with anticipated difficult airway: a prospective randomized controlled study.,"Background The video laryngoscope is an approved airway equipment for use in difficult airway. Borescope has been used in industrial and non-medical uses. The introduction of the borescope for the use in airway management started with the COVID-19 era by putting it over a direct laryngoscope blade to provide an economical video laryngoscope. In the current study, we investigated the use of an endotracheal tube mounted over a borescope versus a video laryngoscope in intubating suspected difficult intubation patients. Method After informed consent, 120 adult patients with suspected difficult intubation undergoing elective surgery were included in this study. Patients were randomized to the USB-borescope group, video laryngoscope group. Time to successful intubation was the primary endpoint. Secondary outcomes included hemodynamic change, operator satisfaction, and incidence of complications in both groups. Results I ntubation time was comparable between both groups (video laryngoscope = 30.63 sec, borescope = 28.35 sec, P = 0.166), yet the clarity of the view was better with the video laryngoscope compared to the borescope (P = 0.026), and incidence of fogging was less with the video laryngoscope (P = 0.015). Operator satisfaction was higher with borescope 1.56 ± 0.62 when compared to video larygoscope 1.21 ± 0.42 (P <0.001). Conclusion Video laryngoscope provided better view and less fogging with comparative intubation time with borescope yet its price limits its availability so a borescope can be a low-cost, readily available piece of equipment for intubating patients with potentially difficult airways.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Immune-Modulating Drug MP1032 with SARS-CoV-2 Antiviral Activity In Vitro: A potential Multi-Target Approach for Prevention and Early Intervention Treatment of COVID-19,"At least since March 2020, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and the multi-organ coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are keeping a firm grip on the world. Although most cases are mild, older patients and those with co-morbidities are at increased risk of developing a cytokine storm, characterized by a systemic inflammatory response leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and organ failure. The present paper focuses on the small molecule MP1032, describes its mode of action, and gives rationale why it is a promising option for the prevention/treatment of the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm. MP1032 is a phase-pure anhydrous polymorph of 5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione sodium salt that exhibits good stability and bioavailability. The physiological action of MP1032 is based on a multi-target mechanism including localized, self-limiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activities that were demonstrated in a model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced joint inflammation. Furthermore, its immune-regulatory and PARP-1-modulating properties, coupled with antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2, have been demonstrated in various cell models. Preclinical efficacy was elucidated in LPS-induced endotoxemia, a model with heightened innate immune responses that shares many similarities to COVID-19. So far, during oral clinical development with three-month daily administrations, no serious adverse drug reactions occurred, highlighting the outstanding safety profile of MP1032.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Management of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review focuses on the therapeutic management and individualized approach to Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), utilizing Food and Drug Administration-approved PAH-specific therapies and various interventional and surgical options for PAH. RECENT FINDINGS: The paradigm for the optimal management of PAH has shifted in recent years. Upfront combination therapy with an endothelin receptor antagonist and a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor is now widely accepted as standard of care. In addition, there is increasing emphasis on starting prostanoids early in order to delay time to clinical worsening. However, less is known regarding which prostanoid agent to initiate and the optimum time to do so. In order to facilitate shared decision-making, there is an increasing need for decision tools based on guidelines and collective clinical experiences to navigate between pharmacologic and interventional treatments, as well as explore innovative, therapeutic pathways for PAH. SUMMARY: The management of PAH has become increasingly complex. With a growing number of PAH-specific therapies, intimate knowledge of the therapeutics and the potential barriers to adherence are integral to providing optimal care for this high-risk patient population. While current PAH-specific therapies largely mediate their effects through pulmonary vasodilation, ongoing research efforts are focused on ways to disrupt the mechanisms leading to pulmonary vascular remodeling. By targeting aberrations identified in the metabolism and proliferative state of pulmonary vascular cells, novel PAH treatment pathways may be just on the horizon.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Projected HIV and Bacterial Sexually Transmitted Infection Incidence Following COVID-19–Related Sexual Distancing and Clinical Service Interruption,"BACKGROUND: The global COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to indirectly impact transmission dynamics and prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI). It is unknown what combined impact reductions in sexual activity and interruptions in HIV/STI services will have on HIV/STI epidemic trajectories. METHODS: We adapted a model of HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia for a population of approximately 103 000 men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Atlanta area. Model scenarios varied the timing, overlap, and relative extent of COVID-19–related sexual distancing and service interruption within 4 service categories (HIV screening, preexposure prophylaxis, antiretroviral therapy, and STI treatment). RESULTS: A 50% relative decrease in sexual partnerships and interruption of all clinical services, both lasting 18 months, would generally offset each other for HIV (total 5-year population impact for Atlanta MSM, −227 cases), but have net protective effect for STIs (−23 800 cases). If distancing lasted only 3 months but service interruption lasted 18 months, the total 5-year population impact would be an additional 890 HIV cases and 57 500 STI cases. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate action to limit the impact of service interruptions is needed to address the indirect effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the HIV/STI epidemic.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Perspectives for repurposing drugs for the coronavirus disease 2019,"The newly emerged 2019 novel coronavirus (CoV), named as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), like SARS-CoV (now, SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), has been associated with high infection rates with over 36,405 deaths. In the absence of approved marketed drugs against coronaviruses, the treatment and management of this novel CoV disease (COVID-19) worldwide is a challenge. Drug repurposing that has emerged as an effective drug discovery approach from earlier approved drugs could reduce the time and cost compared to de novo drug discovery. Direct virus-targeted antiviral agents target specific nucleic acid or proteins of the virus while host-based antivirals target either the host innate immune responses or the cellular machineries that are crucial for viral infection. Both the approaches necessarily interfere with viral pathogenesis. Here we summarize the present status of both virus-based and host-based drug repurposing perspectives for coronaviruses in general and the SARS-CoV-2 in particular.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain: a population study,"Since March of 2020, billions of people worldwide have been asked to limit their social contacts in an effort to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, little research has been carried out to date on the impact of such social distancing measures on the social isolation levels of the population. In this paper, we study the impact of the pandemic on the social isolation of the Spanish population, by means of 32,359 answers to a citizen survey collected over a period of 7 months. We uncover (1) a significant increase in the prevalence of social isolation in the population, reaching almost 26%; (2) gender and age differences, with the largest prevalence of isolation among middle-aged individuals; (3) a strong relationship between economic impact and social isolation; and (4) differences in social isolation, depending on the number of COVID-19 protection measures and on the perception of coronavirus infection risk by our participants. Our research sheds quantitative light on the sociological impact of the pandemic, and enables us to identify key factors in the interplay between the deployment of non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain the spread of an infectious disease and a population's levels of social isolation.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"P021 Rheumatology shielded patients, hospitalised COVID-19 and outcomes in Essex: an audit across Mid and South Essex and Barking, Havering and Redbridge Hospitals NHS Trusts","Background/Aims Shielding measures were implemented within the United Kingdom in an attempt to slow the rate of COVID-19 infections, with shielding letters being sent to extremely vulnerable patients. This included rheumatology patients on immunosuppressive therapies sufficient to increase their risk of infection. Methods This was a retrospective audit assessing the number of rheumatology patients within the Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust (MSE Trust) and Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Trust (BHR Trust) who were sent shielding letters. We audited how effective these measures were in preventing COVID-19 infection during the shielding period (up to 1(st) July 2020). Risk criteria from NHS Digital and the British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) were used by individual departments within these Trusts to identify the relevant patients. We audited from case records demographic details, rheumatological diagnoses, therapies and associated co-morbidities in these patients. Results A total of 5,876 high risk patients within these Trusts were identified and sent shielding letters: 4,914 within the MSE Trust and 962 patients within the BHR Trust. As seen in Table 1, of these 5,876 patients, 28 (0.48%) were hospitalised with positive tests for COVID-19: 23 of the 4,914 (0.47%) in MSE Trust and 5 of the 962 (0.52%) in BHR Trust. Of the 28 COVID-19 admissions, 10 died (36%). The number of rheumatology patients that developed COVID-19 as a proportion of all patients admitted across these two Trusts was 0.76% (28 out of 3,695). Conclusion This audit supports the idea that shielding is an effective tool in protecting these vulnerable patients. Most of our patients admitted were elderly, had multiple co-morbidities and generally conformed with the known risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness. This supports Government guidelines and BSR risk scoring and is particularly important as it is becoming increasingly apparent that COVID-19 will be prevalent for a long time to come. In line with the recent EULAR COVID-19 registry report, only one of the hospitalised patients from these Trusts was on anti-TNF therapy, suggesting that these therapies were in fact protective.

Early computed tomography for acute post-traumatic diffuse axonal injury: a systematic review,"PURPOSE: Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is the rupture of multiple axons due to acceleration and deceleration forces during a closed head injury. Most traumatic brain injuries (TBI) have some degree of DAI, especially severe TBI. Computed tomography (CT) remains the first imaging test performed in the acute phase of TBI, but has low sensitivity for detecting DAI, since DAI is a cellular lesion. The aim of this study is to search in the literature for CT signs, in the first 24 h after TBI, that may help to differentiate patients in groups with a better versus worst prognosis. METHODS: We searched for primary scientific articles in the PubMed database, in English, indexed since January 1st, 2000. RESULTS: Five articles were selected for review. In the DAI group, traffic accidents accounted 70% of the cases, 79% were male, and the mean age was 41 years. There was an association between DAI and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH); an association between the IVH grade and number of corpus callosum lesions; and an association between blood in the interpeduncular cisterns (IPC) and brainstem lesions. CONCLUSION: In closed TBI with no tSAH, severe DAI is unlikely. Similarly, in the absence of IVH, any DAI is unlikely. If there is IVH, patients generally are clinically worse; and the more ventricles affected, the worse the prognosis.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"The COVID-19, policy and capital market: Empirical evidence from Indonesia","This paper aims to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the Indonesian capital market. Second we test whether any policy from regulators could mitigate its effects. By using daily time-series data from January to July we propose the simplest regression model (ordinary least squares) to test its effect. We also conducted some robustness with various sectors and splitting samples to make sure that our findings are robust and consistent. We find that COVID-19 (proxied by new cumulative cases, new deaths and cumulative deaths) has a negative effect on stock price in all indexes i.e. composite Islamic and all sectors (the worst in the financial sector). In other words a higher number of COVID-19 leads to a lower stock price in Indonesia. Second, the regulations from the government (the President Financial Service Authority, Central Bank of Indonesia and Indonesian Stock Exchange) could reduce its negative impact. It means that the negative effect of COVID-10 on the Indonesian stock market is becoming lower after including policies from all regulators. Hence measuring COVID-19s drawbacks on the capital market by relevant policies in Indonesia. It is also quite pivotal to explore which one policy is either effective or ineffective to mitigate COVID-19.

A SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) biological network to find targets for drug repurposing,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus needs a fast recognition of effective drugs to save lives. In the COVID-19 situation, finding targets for drug repurposing can be an effective way to present new fast treatments. We have designed a two-step solution to address this approach. In the first step, we identify essential proteins from virus targets or their associated modules in human cells as possible drug target candidates. For this purpose, we apply two different algorithms to detect some candidate sets of proteins with a minimum size that drive a significant disruption in the COVID-19 related biological networks. We evaluate the resulted candidate proteins sets with three groups of drugs namely Covid-Drug, Clinical-Drug, and All-Drug. The obtained candidate proteins sets approve 16 drugs out of 18 in the Covid-Drug, 273 drugs out of 328 in the Clinical-Drug, and a large number of drugs in the All-Drug. In the second step, we study COVID-19 associated proteins sets and recognize proteins that are essential to disease pathology. This analysis is performed using DAVID to show and compare essential proteins that are contributed between the COVID-19 comorbidities. Our results for shared proteins show significant enrichment for cardiovascular-related, hypertension, diabetes type 2, kidney-related and lung-related diseases.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Urgent Considerations for the Neuro-oncologic Treatment of Patients with Gliomas During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 outbreak is posing unprecedented risks and challenges for all communities and healthcare systems, worldwide. There are unique considerations for many adult patients with gliomas who are vulnerable to the novel coronavirus due to older age and immunosuppression. As patients with terminal illnesses, they present ethical challenges for centers that may need to ration access to ventilator care due to insufficient critical care capacity. It is urgent for the neuro-oncology community to develop a pro-active and coordinated approach to the care of adults with gliomas in order to provide them with the best possible oncologic care while also reducing their risk of viral infection during times of potential healthcare system failure. In this article, we present an approach developed by an international multi-disciplinary group to optimize the care of adults with gliomas during this pandemic. We recommend measures to promote strict social distancing and minimize exposures for patients, address risk and benefit of all therapeutic interventions, pro-actively develop end of life plans, educate patients and caregivers and ensure the health of the multi-disciplinary neuro-oncology workforce. This pandemic is already changing neuro-oncologic care delivery around the globe. It is important to highlight opportunities to maximize the benefit and minimize the risk of glioma management during this pandemic and potentially, in the future.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
A cross-cultural study of competitive intelligence in revenue management,This paper extends the examination of competitive intelligence to revenue management. Revenue management decisions are contingent upon the actions and reactions of competitors. The current study used a cross-cultural approach that compared the use of competitive intelligence by US and Turkish revenue managers by conducting a qualitative study of revenue managers in these locations. Both sets of revenue managers share a similar definition of competitive intelligence and use technology to gather competitive intelligence. The findings also suggest integrity issues for data in Istanbul and that ethical challenges are a central part of competitive intelligence usage.,Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"A comparative study of the sooting tendencies of various C5-C8 alkanes, alkenes and cycloalkanes in counterflow diffusion flames","In this work, sooting tendencies of various vaporized C5-C8 alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes were investigated in a counterflow diffusion flame (CDF) configuration. Mie scattering and laser induced incandescence (LII) were respectively employed to measure the sooting limits and soot volume fraction, both of which were used as quantitative sooting tendency indices of the flames. Research foci were paid to analyze the impacts of fuel molecular structure on sooting tendencies, ranging from the length of the carbon chain, fuel unsaturation, presence and position of the branched chain as well as the cyclic ring structure. It was found that the present CDF-based sooting tendency data did not always agree with existing literature results that were obtained from either coflow or premixed flame experiments, indicating the importance of considering flame conditions when assessing fuel sooting tendencies. Several interesting observations were made; in particular, our results showed that the sooting limits of C5-C8 n-alkane is comparable, regardless of the carbon-chain length, indicating an interesting fuel similarity pertinent to sooting tendency. In addition, we found that cyclopentane, with a five-membered ring, has even stronger sooting propensity than the six-membered cyclohexane; this trend occurs because cyclopentane prefers to decompose to more odd-carbon radicals of cyclopentadienyl and allyl, which are efficient aromatic precursors. Our results are expected to serve as necessary complements to existing sooting index data for a deeper understanding of the correlation between fuel molecular structures and their sooting tendencies.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"A method for measuring urban space density of people and deliver notification, with respect to privacy","The case of Covid-19, and the measures taken worldwide, have driven to the establishment of specific codes of conduct by citizens, and strict rules concerning the density of people. In parallel, efforts to make use of mobile device technologies to help enforce these measures, have led to privacy concerns. In this paper, we present a method for estimating people density in urban spaces, using mobile communication technologies, while protecting privacy. The method is based on counting BT and Wi-Fi enabled devices within range of an autonomous device, isolated from the internet, with the ability to broadcast the crowd density. © 2021 IEEE.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Bin it or pin it? Which professional ethical guidance on managing COVID-19 should I follow?,"BACKGROUND: As the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic develops, healthcare professionals are looking for support with, and guidance to inform, the difficult decisions they face. In the (current) absence of an authoritative national steer in England, professional bodies and local organisations have been developing and disseminating their own ethical guidance. Questions inevitably arise, some of which are particularly pressing during the pandemic, as events are unfolding quickly and the field is becoming crowded. My central question here is: which professional ethical guidance should the professional follow? MAIN BODY: Adopting a working definition of “professional ethical guidance”, I offer three domains for a healthcare professional to consider, and some associated questions to ask, when determining whether – in relation to any guidance document – they should “bin it or pin it”. First, the professional should consider the source of the guidance: is the issuing body authoritative or, if not, at least sufficiently influential that its guidance should be followed? Second, the professional should consider the applicability of the guidance, ascertaining whether the guidance is available and, if so, whether it is pertinent. Pertinence has various dimensions, including whether the guidance applies to this professional, this patient and/or this setting, whether it is up-to-date, and whether the guidance addresses the situation the professional is facing. Third, the professional should consider the methodology and methods by which the guidance was produced. Although the substantive quality of the guidance is important, so too are the methods by which it was produced. Here, the professional should ask whether the guidance is sufficiently inclusive – in terms of who has prepared it and who contributed to its development – and whether it was rigorously developed, and thus utilised appropriate processes, principles and evidence. CONCLUSION: Asking and answering such questions may be challenging, particularly during a pandemic. Furthermore, guidance will not do all the work: professionals will still need to exercise their judgment in deciding what is best in the individual case, whether or not this concerns COVID-19. But such judgments can and should be informed (and constrained) by guidance, and hopefully these preliminary observations will provide some useful pointers for time-pressed professionals.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
TRANSFUSÃO DE PLASMA CONVALESCENTE EM COVID19: ASSOCIAÇÃO ENTRE ANTICORPOS NEUTRALIZANTES E REDUÇÃO DE CARGA VIRAL,"Introdução A transfusão de plasma convalescente tem sido utilizada como terapêutica alternativa no tratamento de COVID19 nos últimos meses. Avaliamos o impacto dos anticorpos neutralizantes produzidos pelos pacientes e dos anticorpos presentes nas unidades transfundidas na redução da carga viral em pacientes em tratamento hospitalar de COVID19. Materiais e métodos Foram avaliados consecutivamente 29 pacientes admitidos para tratamento hospitalar de COVID19 em um único centro. Doses de 300 a 600 ml de plasma convalescente foram administradas ao longo de 2 dias. Foram coletados swabs nasais a cada 48 h a partir do D0 (dia de transfusão de plasma convalescente) até a alta hospitalar, a fim de determinar a carga viral por digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) dos alvos N1 e N2 do gene N (nucleocapsídeo) para análise de redução de carga viral, sendo considerado o número de cópias virais por 1000 células presente na amostra. Mensuramos os títulos de anticorpos neutralizantes (cytopathic effect-based virus neutralization test -SARS-CoV-2 GenBank MT126808.1) dos pacientes (NAbsP) antes da transfusão (D0) e títulos de anticorpos neutralizantes das unidades de plasma transfundidas (NAbsT). Para análise de associação entre NAbsP e redução de carga viral, os pacientes foram divididos em dois grupos de acordo com o status de NAbsP no D0: título de NabsP inferior a 80 e título de NabsP igual ou superior a 80. Para esta análise, foi utilizado o teste de Mann-Whitney . Para verificar a associação entre NAbsT e redução de carga viral, os pacientes foram divididos em três grupos: aqueles que receberam transfusão de plasma convalescente com título de NAbsT até 160, título de NAbsT entre 160-640 e NAbsT superior a 640. Para esta análise, foi utilizado o teste de Kruskall-Wallis. Resultados Pacientes com baixos títulos de neutralizantes à admissão (NAbsP inferior a 80) apresentaram redução de carga viral significativamente maior (p=0,009) que pacientes com NAbsP igual ou superior a 80. Com relação ao impacto da transfusão de plasma, observou-se que quanto maior o título de anticorpos neutralizantes transfundidos maior foi a redução da carga viral; porém, tal achado não apresentou significância estatística (p = 0,528). Discussão O combate e eliminação da viremia através dos anticorpos neutralizantes presentes no plasma convalescente compreende uma das justificativas da sua aplicação como terapia alternativa para COVID19. Contudo, estudos prévios demonstraram resultados contraditórios em relação ao seu impacto no clearance viral. Na presente casuística, pacientes com baixos títulos de anticorpos neutralizantes apresentaram maior redução de carga viral após a transfusão de plasma convalescente do que pacientes com altos títulos. Pacientes que já apresentavam títulos elevados de neutralizantes parecem não se beneficiar da transfusão de plasma no que se refere à redução de carga viral. A estratificação dos pacientes de acordo com os níveis basais de anticorpos neutralizantes parece ser um ponto importante a ser discutido no tratamento de COVID19 com plasma convalescente e fornece uma explicação plausível para os resultados controversos previamente observados.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Visualizing and assessing US county-level COVID19 vulnerability,"BACKGROUND: Like most of the world, the United States’ public health and economy are impacted by the COVID19 pandemic. However, discrete pandemic effects may not be fully realized on the macro-scale. With this perspective, our goal is to visualize spread of the pandemic and measure county-level features which may portend vulnerability. METHODS: We accessed the New York Times GitHub repository COVID19 data and 2018 United States Census data for all United States Counties. The disparate datasets were merged and filtered to allow for visualization and assessments about case fatality rate (CFR%) and associated demographic, ethnic and economic features. RESULTS: Our results suggest that county-level COVID19 fatality rates are related to advanced population age (P < .001) and less diversity as evidenced by higher proportion of Caucasians in High CFR% counties (P < .001). Also, lower CFR% counties had a greater proportion of the population reporting has having 2 or more races (P < .001). We noted no significant differences between High and Low CFR% counties with respect to mean income or poverty rate. CONCLUSIONS: Unique COVID19 impacts are realized at the county level. Use of public datasets, data science skills and information visualization can yield helpful insights to drive understanding about community-level vulnerability.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Analysis of the pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19 in Hubei Province,"Objective: To study the effect of COVID-19 on pregnancy outcomes and neonatal prognosis in Hubei Province Methods: A retrospective comparison of the pregnancy outcomes was done between 16 women with COVID-19 and 45 women without COVID-19 Also, the results of laboratory tests, imaging examinations, and the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test were performed in 10 cases of neonatal deliverd from women with COVID-19 Results: (1) Of the 16 pregnant women with COVID-19, 15 cases were ordinary type and 1 case was severe type No one has progressed to critical pneumonia The delivery method of the two groups was cesarean section, and the gestational age were (38 7±1 4) and (37 9±1 6) weeks, there was no significant difference between the two groups (P&gt; 0 05) Also, there wee no significant differences in the intraoperative blood loss and birth weight of the newborn between the two groups (all P&gt;0 05) (2) Ten cases of neonates delivered from pregnant women with COVID-19 were collected The 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test were all negative There were no significant differences in fetal distress, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, preterm birth, and neonatal asphyxia between the two groups (all P&gt;0 05) (3) In the treatment of uterine contraction fatigue, carbetocin or carboprost tromethamine was used more in cesarean section for pregnant women with COVID-19 (1 3±0 6), compared with Non-COVID-19 group (0 5±0 7), the difference was statistically significant (P=0 001) Conclusions: If there is an indication for obstetric surgery or critical illness of COVID-19 in pregnant women, timely termination of pregnancy will not increase the risk of premature birth and asphyxia of the newborn, but it is beneficial to the treatment and rehabilitation of maternal pneumonia Preventive use of long-acting uterotonic agents could reduce the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage during surgery 2019-nCoV infection has not been found in neonates deliverd from pregnant women with COVID-19",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Chinese Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Characteristics and Particularity,"More than half of new cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and associated deaths occurring annually worldwide are recorded in China. Chinese patients with HCC exhibit special characteristics in terms of etiology, leading to differences in prognosis versus Western patients. In recent years, several angiogenesis inhibitors were approved, and immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) were recommended as second-line therapy for advanced HCC. In addition, the recent success of a combination of atezolizumab with bevacizumab signals resulted in an essential change in the first-line treatment of HCC. We investigated the characteristics of patients with HCC in China and summarized the rapidly emerging relevant clinical data, which relate to the prospects and challenges associated with the use of ICBs in this setting. We further evaluated the efficacy of ICBs in Chinese patients with HCC based on data obtained from global trials, and discussed possible factors influencing the effectiveness of ICBs in patients with HCC in China. Immunotherapy offers new options for the treatment of advanced HCC, though responses varied between patients. Currently, there is a need to discover specific biomarkers for the accurate identification of patients who would more likely benefit from immunotherapy. Furthermore, investigation of patient characteristics in different countries is necessary to provide a clinical practice basis and reference value for the diagnosis and treatment of HCC.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
The underpinning biology relating to multiple sclerosis disease modifying treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 viral infection causes COVID-19 that can result in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can cause significant mortality, leading to concern that immunosuppressive treatments for multiple sclerosis and other disorders have significant risks for both infection and ARDS. OBJECTIVE: To examine the biology that potentially underpins immunity to the SARS-Cov-2 virus and the immunity-induced pathology related to COVID-19 and determine how this impinges on the use of current disease modifying treatments in multiple sclerosis. OBSERVATIONS: Although information about the mechanisms of immunity are scant, it appears that monocyte/macrophages and then CD8 T cells are important in eliminating the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This may be facilitated via anti-viral antibody responses that may prevent re-infection. However, viral escape and infection of leucocytes to promote lymphopenia, apparent CD8 T cell exhaustion coupled with a cytokine storm and vascular pathology appears to contribute to the damage in ARDS. IMPLICATIONS: In contrast to ablative haematopoietic stem cell therapy, most multiple-sclerosis-related disease modifying therapies do not particularly target the innate immune system and few have any major long-term impact on CD8 T cells to limit protection against COVID-19. In addition, few block the formation of immature B cells within lymphoid tissue that will provide antibody-mediated protection from (re)infection. However, adjustments to dosing schedules may help de-risk the chance of infection further and reduce the concerns of people with MS being treated during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Treatment failure definitions for non-purulent skin and soft tissue infections: a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE There is currently no uniform definition for antimicrobial treatment failure for adults with non-purulent skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). The objective of this systematic review was to identify treatment failure definitions and their common components in the literature. METHODS Five electronic databases were searched from inception to March 2019. Two independent reviewers identified studies involving adults (age ≥ 18 years) with non-purulent SSTIs in which antimicrobial treatment failure was a defined outcome. There were no language restrictions. Only randomized trials or observational studies were included. RESULTS After screening 4953 abstracts, 26 studies (N = 6629 patients) met full inclusion criteria. Reported treatment failure ranged from 0 to 29.5%. The most common definition components were hospital admission (78.9%), change in antibiotics (65.4%), and persistent or worsening signs and symptoms of infection (34.6%). Only one study listed specific criteria for persistent or worsening signs and symptoms of infection. CONCLUSIONS For studies involving non-purulent SSTIs, the outcome of treatment failure is inconsistently defined and reported failure rates are highly variable. This systematic review has highlighted the need for more robust treatment failure definitions for non-purulent SSTIs. Research should focus on the development of a uniform treatment failure definition that should be used in future studies.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
On-farm evaluation of a predictive model for Australian beef and sheep producers' vulnerability to an outbreak of foot and mouth disease,"To explore Australian sheep and beef producer vulnerability to an emergency animal disease outbreak, Bayesian Network models have been developed, with the ultimate goal of creating risk management tool for outbreak preparedness. These models were developed using multiple stakeholder elicitation including modelling experts, epidemiologists and on-farm stakeholders, including on-farm/survey data. An evaluation of the model's predictive capacity was conducted, using independent, blinded on-farm vulnerability assessments. Nine properties were visited, four each with sheep and beef enterprises, and one mixed enterprise. There were some discrepancies between the model predictions and on-farm assessment in the beef enterprises, with greater disparity with the sheep properties. Discrepancies between the model predictions and on-farm assessments have created opportunities for examination of the data collection process for the model development, the model itself and the on-farm assessment process. Bayesian Network approaches that allow for the inclusion of both continuous and discrete variables may improve the usefulness of these models, avoiding the loss of nuanced data by the need for discretisation of continuous variables, as will the inclusion of input from on-farm stakeholders in model development. Future work includes more data collection to improve the sensitivity of the model predictions, and a deeper, systemic exploration of the factors that may impact Australian producers' vulnerability to an emergency animal disease outbreak.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Both Boceprevir and GC376 efficaciously inhibit SARS-CoV-2 by targeting its main protease,"COVID-19 was declared a pandemic on March 11 by WHO, due to its great threat to global public health. The coronavirus main protease (M(pro), also called 3CLpro) is essential for processing and maturation of the viral polyprotein, therefore recognized as an attractive drug target. Here we show that a clinically approved anti-HCV drug, Boceprevir, and a pre-clinical inhibitor against feline infectious peritonitis (corona) virus (FIPV), GC376, both efficaciously inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells by targeting M(pro). Moreover, combined application of GC376 with Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue that inhibits viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), results in sterilizing additive effect. Further structural analysis reveals binding of both inhibitors to the catalytically active side of SARS-CoV-2 protease M(pro) as main mechanism of inhibition. Our findings may provide critical information for the optimization and design of more potent inhibitors against the emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
COVID-19 vaccine mRNA-1273 elicits a protective immune profile in mice that is not associated with vaccine-enhanced disease upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge,"Vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) was previously observed in some preclinical models of SARS and MERS coronavirus vaccines. We used the SARS-CoV-2 MA10 mouse model of acute lung injury to evaluate the immune response and potential for immunopathology in animals vaccinated with research-grade mRNA-1273. Whole-inactivated virus or heat-denatured spike protein subunit vaccines with alum designed to elicit low-potency antibodies and Th2-skewed CD4+ T cells resulted in reduced viral titers and weight loss post-challenge, but more severe pathological changes in the lung compared to saline-immunized animals. In contrast, a protective dose of mRNA-1273 induced favorable humoral and cellular immune responses that protected from viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract upon challenge. A subprotective dose of mRNA-1273 reduced viral replication and limited histopathological manifestations compared to animals given saline. Overall, our findings demonstrate an immunological signature associated with antiviral protection without disease enhancement following vaccination with mRNA-1273.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Structural Understanding of Interleukin 6 Family Cytokine Signaling and Targeted Therapies: Focus on Interleukin 11,"Cytokines are small signaling proteins that have central roles in inflammation and cell survival. In the half-century since the discovery of the first cytokines, the interferons, over fifty cytokines have been identified. Amongst these is interleukin (IL)-6, the first and prototypical member of the IL-6 family of cytokines, nearly all of which utilize the common signaling receptor, gp130. In the last decade, there have been numerous advances in our understanding of the structural mechanisms of IL-6 family signaling, particularly for IL-6 itself. However, our understanding of the detailed structural mechanisms underlying signaling by most IL-6 family members remains limited. With the emergence of new roles for IL-6 family cytokines in disease and, in particular, roles of IL-11 in cardiovascular disease, lung disease, and cancer, there is an emerging need to develop therapeutics that can progress to clinical use. Here we outline our current knowledge of the structural mechanism of signaling by the IL-6 family of cytokines. We discuss how this knowledge allows us to understand the mechanism of action of currently available inhibitors targeting IL-6 family cytokine signaling, and most importantly how it allows for improved opportunities to pharmacologically disrupt cytokine signaling. We focus specifically on the need to develop and understand inhibitors that disrupt IL-11 signaling.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
A novel structure for online surgical undergraduate teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic necessitated the delivery of online higher education. Online learning is a novel experience for medical education in Sri Lanka. A novel approach to undergraduate surgical learning was taken up in an attempt to improve the interest amongst the students in clinical practice while maximizing the limited contact time. METHOD: Online learning activity was designed involving medical students from all stages and multi consultant panel discussions. The discussions were designed to cover each topic from basic sciences to high-level clinical management in an attempt to stimulate the student interest in clinical medicine. Online meeting platform with free to use basic plan and a social media platform were used in combination to communicate with the students. The student feedback was periodically assessed for individual topics as well as for general outcome. Lickert scales and numeric scales were used to acquire student agreement on the desired learning outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1047 student responses for 7 questionnaires were analysed. During a 6-week period, 24 surgical topics were discussed with 51 contact hours. Eighty-seven per cent definitely agreed (highest agreement) with the statement ‘students benefitted from the discussions’. Over 95% have either participated for all or most sessions. A majority of the respondents (83.4%) ‘definitely agreed’ that the discussions helped to improve their clinical sense. Of the total respondents, 79.3% definitely agreed that the discussions helped to build an interest in clinical medicine. Around 90% agreed that both exam-oriented and clinical practice-oriented topics were highly important and relevant. Most widely raised concerns were the poor Internet connectivity and limitation of access to the meeting platform. CONCLUSION: Online teaching with a novel structure is feasible and effective in a resource-limited setting. Students agree that it could improve clinical interest while meeting the expected learning outcomes.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
A Comparative Study of Deep Learning Methods for Time-series Forecasting Tourism Business Recovery from the Covid- 19 Pandemic Crisis,"This research aims to present a comparison of deep learning techniques when working with time-series data to predict the recovery and resilience of tourism businesses in Thailand. This type of business generates a lot of income and plays a role in the development of the country. However, Thailand's tourism industry although has its identity and strengths, but it cannot survive the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic. The biggest impacts of COVID-19 to tourism business are unemployment of the population and the slowdown in national development. Recognizing the importance of tourism as mentioned above, the researchers compared the functioning of three deep learning methods which consists of Vanilla LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, and Stacked LSTM, when used with time-series data during the year 2020-2024 to planning the rehabilitation of Thailand's tourism business. The experimental results show that, Bidirectional LSTM is the most effective deep learning model when working with time-series data compared to Vanilla LSTM and Stacked LSTM, by considering average error of the Bidirectional LSTM when working with time-series data, which is equal to 5.85916575 which has a lower average error value less than that of the average error of Vanilla LSTM and Stacked LSTM, which are equal to 5.91683425 and 5.92949325 respectively. The results of this research can be concluded that, the deep learning with Bidirectional LSTM approach is the most efficient choice for working with time-series data, when applied to 5 years data and compare with the Vanilla LSTM and Stacked LSTM. In addition, this research also shows a good practice to implement deep learning to the tourism business.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Training Willpower: Reducing Costs and Valuing Effort,"The integrative model of effortful control presented in a previous article aimed to specify the neurophysiological bases of mental effort. This model assumes that effort reflects three different inter-related aspects of the same adaptive function. First, a mechanism anchored in the salience network that makes decisions about the effort that should be engaged in the current task in view of costs and benefits associated with the achievement of the task goal. Second, a top-down control signal generated by the mechanism of effort that modulates neuronal activity in brain regions involved in the current task to filter pertinent information. Third, a feeling that emerges in awareness during effortful tasks and reflects the costs associated with goal-directed behavior. The aim of the present article is to complete this model by proposing that the capacity to exert effortful control can be improved through training programs. Two main questions relative to this possible strengthening of willpower are addressed in this paper. The first question concerns the existence of empirical evidence that supports gains in effortful control capacity through training. We conducted a review of 63 meta-analyses that shows training programs are effective in improving performance in effortful tasks tapping executive functions and/or self-control with a small to large effect size. Moreover, physical and mindfulness exercises could be two promising training methods that would deserve to be included in training programs aiming to strengthen willpower. The second question concerns the neural mechanisms that could explain these gains in effortful control capacity. Two plausible brain mechanisms are proposed: (1) a decrease in effort costs combined with a greater efficiency of brain regions involved in the task and (2) an increase in the value of effort through operant conditioning in the context of high effort and high reward. The first mechanism supports the hypothesis of a strengthening of the capacity to exert effortful control whereas the second mechanism supports the hypothesis of an increase in the motivation to exert this control. In the last part of the article, we made several recommendations to improve the effectiveness of interventional studies aiming to train this adaptive function.""Keep the faculty of effort alive in you by a little gratuitous exercise every day.""James (1918, p. 127).",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19: filling the gap between myocarditis and Kawasaki?,"Myocarditis and Kawasaki disease are common but usually distinct diseases in children. During the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), reports of a new form of myocarditis with clinical features of Kawasaki appeared. We investigated the place of this new disease in the spectrum encompassing Kawasaki disease and myocarditis.Thirty two consecutive children referred to our centre for a suspicion of Kawasaki or a diagnosis of myocarditis were included and eventually divided into four groups: 11 Kawasaki diseases, 6 Kawasaki syndromes (children with another diagnosis), 7 myocarditis without Kawasaki clinical feature and 7 myocarditis with incomplete Kawasaki clinical features. All were treated with immunoglobulins except those of the myocarditis group. The survival rate was 91%. The 7 children with myocarditis and clinical features of incomplete Kawasaki were all positive for SARS-CoV-2. They had a transient myocardial failure with a favourable course and none had coronary artery disease.Conclusion: Every COVID-19 child within our population had a mild to severe myocarditis and presented with fever plus two or three Kawasaki clinical features. Short-term evolution was good for these children. This new disease seems to fill the gap between isolated myocarditis and Kawasaki disease. What is Known: â¢ A new paediatric disease close to Kawasaki disease appeared during the COVID-19 pandemic What is New: â¢ In our population, children presented with fever, vivid Kawasaki clinical features (although the Kawasaki syndrome was always incomplete) and a myocarditis without coronary abnormalities. â¢ The new disease fills the gap between paediatric myocarditis and Kawasaki disease but its prognosis is much better.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Exploring Informal Caregivers’ Priorities of Nursing Home Dementia Care From Communities of Color,"Informal caregivers are critical stakeholders in nursing home (NH) care for individuals with dementia. Given racial and ethnic disparities in United States NHs, there is a need to understand informal caregivers’ perspectives, particularly among those that identify as members of a community of color. We conducted a scoping review of informal caregiver priorities of nursing home dementia care. Included studies exclusively examined priorities of informal caregivers identifying as Black, Indigenous, or people of color. The final sample (n=12) included two United States studies representing African American and Korean informal caregivers. The remaining studies were conducted in other countries. Informal caregivers expressed a desire for professional support during the nursing home transition, increased staff knowledge of dementia, and improved resident engagement. These findings highlight the paucity of informal caregivers identifying as Black, Indigenous, or people of color represented in US nursing home dementia research. Future efforts must include communities of color.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Semi-free forearm flap for pharyngeal-esophageal reconstruction after radiation therapy.,"Reconstruction of the pharynx and upper esophagus uses various procedures, including pedicled or free flap. Pharyngoplasty with free forearm flap provides excellent functional results. In radiation-related pharyngeal stenosis, recipient vascularization is often poor, especially in the venous system. The authors describe pharyngeal reconstruction with semi-free forearm flap, pedicled on the cephalic vein, to minimize the risk of venous thrombosis, which is the main factor of free forearm flap necrosis. Taking the case of a laryngectomy with complete pharyngeal stenosis after radiation therapy and iterative neck surgery, the technique of pharyngeal-esophageal reconstruction by semi-free forearm flap is described in a context of impaired vascularization.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Views and Experiences of LGBTQ+ People in Prison Regarding Their Psychosocial Needs: A Systematic Review of the Qualitative Research Evidence.,"People who identify as LGBTQ+ and are in prison often experience many additional challenges. Once in prison, there is systemic discrimination against imprisoned LGBTQ+ people and a lack of understanding and concern regarding their care, treatment and support needs. While there is growing interest in their protection and that of other vulnerable populations in prison settings, little is known about their views and experiences regarding their distinct psychosocial needs. The aim of this systematic review is to critically evaluate and synthesize the existing research evidence relating to the unique psychological and social experiences of LGBTQ+ people in prison and identify aspects that may help or hinder access to appropriate psychosocial interventions and supports. The PRISMA procedure was utilized. A search of relevant databases from January 2010 to March 2021 was undertaken. Studies were identified that involved LGBTQ+ people, and addressed their views and experiences regarding their psychosocial needs whilst in prison. The search yielded 858 papers in total. Following the application of rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria a total of 12 papers were considered suitable for the systematic review. Quality was assessed using the CASP instrument. Following analysis, three themes were identified: (i) interpersonal factors (ii) intrapersonal factors and (iii) institutional factors. The policy, education and practice development implications are highlighted and discussed. Future research opportunities have been identified that will add significantly to the body of evidence that may further the development of appropriate health interventions and supports specific to the LGBTQ+ population in prison.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Factors associated with physicians' decision making during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic,"BACKGROUND: Frontline medical staff, combating the Covid-19 pandemic are forced to make clinical and behavioral decisions daily. Their decision-making process and the factors associated with it, are of utmost importance in preserving and supporting their own health and their patient's health. AIMS: Tto explore the factors associated with physicians' decision-making during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel METHODS: Cross- sectional data were collected among 200 physicians at the Israeli health care system between March and May 2020 via an online questionnaire. A multiple hierarchical regression was calculated to assess the contribution of the study variables to the physicians' decision making. RESULTS: Most physicians reported that they complied with hygiene guidelines at work, issued by the Israeli ministry of health (MOH), fully (42%) or very often (31%), and with the MOH COVID-19 behavior guidelines fully (27%), very often (34%), or in general (23%). According to the study RESULTS: trust, positive emotions, perception of COVID-19 threat, and risk perceptions were found significant and positive. In other words, higher trust, more positive emotions, and perceptions of greater threat and risk, were associated with higher compliance with the MOH guidelines and more cautious decision making. CONCLUSIONS: While threat and risk perceptions may be inevitable during the pandemic, trust and positive emotions may act as protective factors, encouraging cautious decision making among physicians. KEY MESSAGES: Physicians' decision making is a complex process affected by their perceptions, emotions, and trust levels. High levels of trust and positive emotions may facilitate carful decision making.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Prevalence of Hypertension in Homeless Adults: An Interprofessional Education Community-Based Health Fairs Cross-Sectional Study in Urban Long Beach, California","INTRODUCTION: Hypertension (SBP/DBP > 130/80 mmHg) is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease worldwide. AIM: To determine the prevalence of hypertension in a homeless community during an interprofessional education (IPE)-based health fair. METHODS: Homeless participants were recruited between August 2019–September 2019. Faculty, nursing, and pharmacist students, educated 477 participants, aged 18–80 years, on the risk factors associated with untreated hypertension. Then, participants self-completed the consented demographic survey questionnaire. Finally, the sitting blood pressure (BP) was recorded three times based on a standardized procedure, using Omron BPN monitor with cuff. RESULTS: Seven pharmacy students, nine nursing students, two registered nurses, five registered pharmacists, and two medical doctors collaboratively provided health education to the homeless community and screened their sitting BP. 390/477 (81.8%) of participants satisfied the inclusion criteria. Participants (54.7%) of the reported education level was at the high School level or less. More than the half of the participants (average age of 51 ± 13 years) had hypertension (median SBP/DBP ≥ 130/82.7 mmHg), respectively. The prevalence of hypertension for the overall cohort was 61.52% (95% CI, 56.59–66.35). Age (p value = 0.000) was significantly associated with hypertension based on the binary logistic analysis. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a high prevalence of hypertension in the homeless community in Long Beach, California with high risk of cardio-vascular events or strokes. This works sheds new light on an issue of major public health significance and points to the need for fostering IPE community-based health fairs intervention program for the US homeless population.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
How Times of Crisis Serve as a Catalyst for Creative Action: An Agentic Perspective,"The human experience is punctuated by times of crisis Some crises are experienced at a personal level (e g , the diagnosis of a life-threatening disease), organizational level (e g , a business facing bankruptcy), and still others are experienced on a societal or global level (e g , COVID-19 pandemic) Although crises can be deeply troubling and anxiety provoking, they can also serve as an important catalyst for creative action and innovative outcomes This is because during times of crisis our typical forms of reasoning and action may no longer serve us It is precisely during such times that new ways of thought, action and leadership are needed A key question for researchers to consider is: Why and how times of crisis serve as an impetus for creative actions and outcomes? The purpose of this paper is to address this question I open by briefly discussing the features of a crisis I then introduce an empirically testable, process model that outlines various pathways, factors, and outcomes associated with different ways people and organizations respond during times of crisis I close by briefly outlining future directions for creativity theory and research",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Can nutraceuticals assist treatment and improve covid-19 symptoms?,"Viral diseases have always played an important role in public and individual health. Since December 2019, the world is facing a pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus that results in a syndrome known as COVID-19. Several studies were conducted to implement antiviral drug therapy, until the arrival of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Numerous scientific investigations have considered some nutraceuticals as an additional treatment of COVID-19 patients to improve their clinical picture. In this review, we would like to emphasize the studies conducted to date about this issue and try to understand whether the use of nutraceuticals as a supplementary therapy to COVID-19 may be a valid and viable avenue. Based on the results obtained so far, quercetin, astaxanthin, luteolin, glycyrrhizin, lactoferrin, hesperidin and curcumin have shown encouraging data suggesting their use to prevent and counteract the symptoms of this pandemic infection.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Fentanyl versus Remifentanil for Cough Suppression and Recovery after Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery.,"Background Various methods have been used to reduce postoperative pain after thoracic surgery. However, these methods may affect the patient's respiratory response and delay recovery from anesthesia. We aimed to evaluate the effects of fentanyl and remifentanil during extubation after video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). Methods This study included 45 randomly-selected male patients who underwent VATS for pneumothorax between July 2011 and August 2012. We divided the participants into 3 groups: the F group, which received a bolus injection of 1.0 μg/kg of fentanyl; the R1 group, which received a 0.04 μg/kg/min remifentanil infusion; and the R2 group, which received a 0.08 μg/kg/min remifentanil infusion. Hemodynamics, pain, cough, consciousness level, and nausea were assessed for each group. Results The number and severity of coughs were lower in the R1 and R2 groups than in the F group, and there were no differences between the R1 and R2 groups. Respiratory depression and loss of consciousness were not observed in any of the patients, and there were no differences in hemodynamics. Conclusion In comparison with fentanyl, remifentanil did not result in a wide fluctuation of blood pressure and heart rate upon emergence from general anesthesia. Moreover, remifentanil contributed to cough suppression and postoperative pain control. Remifentanil seems to be a safe and effective analgesic after VATS.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Cost-effectiveness of uterine tamponade devices for the treatment of postpartum haemorrhage: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND Uterine tamponade is widely promoted for treating refractory postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), however its cost-effectiveness may vary depending on unit costs and setting. OBJECTIVE To review available data on cost-effectiveness of uterine tamponade devices when used for PPH treatment. SEARCH STRATEGY PubMed and EMBASE were searched (1980 to January 2020), as well as the National Health Services Economic Evaluation database from inception (1995) to March 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA Eligible studies were any type of economic evaluation, or effectiveness studies that provided cost or economic data. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed quality. MAIN RESULTS Eleven studies using a range of devices (condom catheter, uterine suction devices, Bakri, Inpress, Ellavi) were identified. Cost of condom catheter devices or kits ranged from US$0.64 to US$6, while purpose-designed devices were up to US$400. Two studies that took a health system perspective assessed cost-effectiveness of using uterine balloon tamponade and suggested it was highly cost-effective due to low cost per disability-adjusted life years (DALY) averted, though both used effect estimates from case series. CONCLUSIONS Evidence on the cost-effectiveness of uterine tamponade devices was limited and not generalizable. Rigorous economic evaluations based on updated effect estimates are needed.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Understanding Covid and the associated post- infectious hyper-inflammatory inflammatory state (PIMS-TS) in children,"Summary When SARS-CoV2 infection was first reported from China, very few children had severe lung or systemic disease. Approximately six weeks after the first adult cases were reported in the United Kingdom, a small subgroup of children of largely non-white backgrounds, presented with severe hyper-inflammatory disease, most likely associated with Covid. The possible reasons for this ethnic predilection are explored.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Emerging and re-emerging bacterial zoonoses in Nigeria: current preventive measures and future approaches to intervention,"A characteristic of bacterial zoonoses, diseases caused by bacteria that can be transmitted to humans from animals, is a propensity to re-emerge. Several studies demonstrate their ongoing transmission in Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa. However, as local epidemiological data on bacterial zoonoses are inadequate the extent and impact of these infectious diseases is under-reported. Consequently, they are not a targeted priority of national public health policies. This limited recognition is despite indications of their possible roles in the widespread prevalence of non-malarial undifferentiated fever in Nigeria. While a number of animal reservoirs and arthropod vectors have been identified in the transmission routes of these diseases, an escalation of cases of undiagnosed febrile illness highlights the urgent need for a comprehensive assessment of other potential reservoirs, vectors and transmission cycles that may increase the local risk of infection with bacterial zoonoses. Animal health interventions have been proposed as a cost-effective strategy. Here, we present a broad overview of bacterial zoonotic infections of humans in Nigeria in the context of evolving epidemiological patterns. Further, we propose that facilitating the operation of a community-based One Health program is essential to providing the comprehensive epidemiological information that is required to improve prioritization of bacterial zoonoses. This would provide a driver for much needed investment in relevant public health interventions in Africa's most populous country.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Operational Innovation in the Provision of Pediatric Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children.,"Treatment of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) can require significant critical care resources. Our aim is to alert mixed pediatric and adult hospitals worldwide of the possibility that pediatric and adult patients may simultaneously require cannulation to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for MIS-C and severe COVID-19. We conducted a retrospective review of operations required to treat cardiogenic shock in 3 pediatric patients with a diagnosis of MIS-C admitted to a single medium-sized pediatric referral center located within a large academic medical center over a 14-day period. At this time, a large number of adult patients required ECMO for severe COVID-19 at our institution. Of the 11 pediatric patients who presented with MIS-C during the first surge of 2020, 2 patients required cannulation to venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO), and a third patient developed a life-threatening arrhythmia requiring transfer to a neighboring institution for consideration of VA-ECMO when our institution's ECMO capacity had briefly been reached. Pediatric referral centers located within institutions providing ECMO to adult patients with severe COVID-19 may benefit from frequent and direct communication with their adult and regional colleagues to devise a collaborative plan for safe and timely provision of ECMO to patients with MIS-C as the ongoing pandemic continues to consume this limited, lifesaving resource.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV prevalence and related sexual and substance use risk practices among key populations who access HIV prevention, treatment and related services in South Africa: findings from a seven-city cross-sectional survey (2017)","BACKGROUND: People who use drugs including people who inject drugs (PWUD/ID), sex workers (SWs) and men who have sex with men (MSM) are at increased risk of HIV and viral hepatitis infection. Limited epidemiological data on the infections exists in key populations (KPs) in South Africa. We investigated the prevalence of hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV and selected risk factors among these KPs to inform effective responses. METHODS: We used convenience sampling to recruit a targeted 3500 KPs accessing HIV-related health services across Cape Town (SWs, MSM, PWUD/ID), Durban (SWs, PWUD/ID), Pietermaritzburg (SWs), Mthatha (SWs), Port Elizabeth (SWs), Johannesburg (MSM) and Pretoria (MSM and PWUD/ID) into a cross-sectional survey. An interviewer questionnaire to assess socio-demographic characteristics, drug use and sexual risk practices, was administered. HBV surface antigen (HBsAg); HCV antibody, viral load and genotype, and HIV antibody, was tested. RESULTS: Among the 3439 people included in the study (1528 SWs, 746 MSM, 1165 PWUD/ID) the median age was 29 years, most participants were black African (60%), and 24% reported homelessness. 82% reported substance use in the last month, including alcohol (46%) and heroin (33%). 75% were sexually active in the previous month, with condom use at last sex at 74%. HIV prevalence was 37% (highest among SWs at 47%), HBsAg prevalence 4% (similar across KPs) and HCV prevalence was 16% (highest among PWUD/ID at 46%). CONCLUSIONS: HBV, HCV and HIV pose a health burden for KPs in South Africa. While HIV is key for all included KPs, HCV is of particular importance to PWUD/ID. For KPs, HBV vaccination and behavioural change interventions that support consistent condom and lubricant access and use are needed. Coverage of opioid substitution therapy and needle and syringe services, and access to HCV treatment for PWUD/ID need to be expanded.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Meditating in Virtual Reality 3: 360° Video of Perceptual Presence of Instructor,"Objectives: The need for remote delivery of mental health interventions including instruction in meditation has become paramount in the wake of the current global pandemic. However, the support one may usually feel within the physical presence of an instructor may be weakened when interventions are delivered remotely, potentially impacting one's meditative experiences. Use of head-mounted displays (HMD) to display video-recorded instruction may increase one's sense of psychological presence with the instructor as compared to presentation via regular flatscreen (e.g., laptop) monitor. This research therefore evaluated a didactic, trauma-informed care approach to instruction in mindfulness meditation by comparing meditative responses to an instructor-guided meditation when delivered face-to-face vs. by pre-recorded 360° videos viewed either on a standard flatscreen monitor (2D format) or via HMD (i.e., virtual reality [VR] headset; 3D format). Methods: Young adults (n = 82) were recruited from a university introductory course and experienced a 360° video-guided meditation via HMD (VR condition, 3D format). They were also randomly assigned to practice the same meditation either via scripted face-to-face instruction (in vivo [IV] format) or when viewed on a standard laptop display (non-VR condition, 2D format). Positive and negative affect and meditative experience ratings were self-reported and participants' maintenance of focused attention to breathing (i.e., meditation breath attention scores [MBAS]) were recorded during each meditation. Results: Meditating in VR (3D format) was associated with a heightened experience of awe overall. When compared to face-to-face instruction (IV format), VR meditation was rated as less embarrassing but also less enjoyable and more tiring. When compared to 2D format, VR meditations were associated with greater experiences of relaxation, less distractibility from the process of breathing, and less fatigue. No differences were found between VR and non-VR meditation in concentration (MBAS). Baseline posttraumatic stress symptoms were risk factors for experiencing distress while meditating in either (VR and non-VR) instructional format. Of those who reported a preference for one format, approximately half preferred the VR format and approximately half preferred the IV format. Conclusions: Recorded 360° video instruction in meditation viewed with a HMD (i.e., VR/3D format) appears to offer some experiential advantage over instructions given in 2D format and may offer a safe-and for some even preferred-alternative to teaching meditation face-to-face.

Mapping LGBTQ+ Youth Resource Density Across Four High HIV Prevalence Corridors in the US,"INTRODUCTION: Studies using geospatial data to understand LGBTQ+-friendly sexual health and wellness resource availability have often focused on services catered to adults. While HIV rates have increased in adolescents in recent years, few studies have explored disparities in resource access for adolescent gay and bisexual men (AGBMSM). METHODS: We used geospatial data of resources (collected and verified 2017–2018) from the iReach app to understand disparities in resource access for AGBMSM within and between 4 high HIV prevalence corridors in the US. RESULTS: AGBMSM in non-metro areas had access to fewer resources and some rural counties had no LGBTQ+ -friendly resources. Corridors comprising states with legacies of punitive laws targeting sexual and gender minorities demonstrate stark geographic disparities across the US. CONCLUSIONS: Policy-makers must understand the granularity of disparities within regions. Online resources may be able to surmount LGBTQ+ resource deserts. However, physical access to LGBTQ+ -friendly services must be improved as a fundamental strategy for reducing HIV among AGBMSM.

The Pelargonium sidoides Extract EPs 7630 Drives the Innate Immune Defense by Activating Selected MAP Kinase Pathways in Human Monocytes,"Pelargonium sidoides is a medical herb and respective extracts are used very frequently for the treatment of respiratory tract infections. However, the effects of Pelargonium sidoides and a special extract prepared from its roots (EPs 7630) on human immune cells are not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that EPs 7630 induced a rapid and dose-dependent production of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 by human blood immune cells. This EPs 7630-induced cytokine profile was more pro-inflammatory in comparison with the profile induced by viral or bacterial infection-mimicking agents. The search for EPs 7630 target cells revealed that T-cells did not respond to EPs 7630 stimulation by production of TNF-α, IL-6, or IL-10. Furthermore, pretreatment of T-cells with EPs 7630 did not modulate their TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 secretion during subsequent activation. In contrast to lymphocytes, monocytes showed clear intracellular TNF-α staining after EPs 7630 treatment. Accordingly, EPs 7630 predominantly provoked activation of MAP kinases and inhibition of p38 strongly reduced the monocyte TNF-α production. The pretreatment of blood immune cells with EPs 7630 lowered their secretion of TNF-α and IL-10 and caused an IL-6 dominant response during second stimulation with viral or bacterial infection-mimicking agents. In summary, we demonstrate that EPs 7630 activates human monocytes, induces MAP kinase-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines in these cells, and specifically modulates their production capacity of mediators known to lead to an increase of acute phase protein production in the liver, neutrophil generation in the bone marrow, and the generation of adaptive Th17 and Th22 cells.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Prophylactic Role of Ivermectin in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection Among Healthcare Workers,"Introduction Healthcare workers (HCWs) are vulnerable to getting infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Preventing HCWs from getting infected is a priority to maintain healthcare services. The therapeutic and preventive role of ivermectin in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is being investigated. Based on promising results of in vitro studies of oral ivermectin, this study was conducted with the aim to demonstrate the prophylactic role of oral ivermectin in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Bhubaneswar. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted at AIIMS Bhubaneswar, which has been providing both COVID and non-COVID care since March 2020. All employees and students of the institute who provided written informed consent participated in the study. The uptake of two doses of oral ivermectin (300 μg/kg/dose at a gap of 72 hours) was considered as exposure. The primary outcome of the study was COVID-19 infection in the following month of ivermectin consumption, diagnosed as per Government of India testing criteria (real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) guidelines. The log-binomial model was used to estimate adjusted relative risk (ARR), and the Kaplan-Meier failure plot was used to estimate the probability of COVID-19 infection with follow-up time. Results Of 3892 employees, 3532 (90.8%) participated in the study. The ivermectin uptake was 62.5% and 5.3% for two doses and single dose, respectively. Participants who took ivermectin prophylaxis had a lower risk of getting symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection (6% vs 15%). HCWs who had taken two doses of oral ivermectin had a significantly lower risk of contracting COVID-19 infection during the following month (ARR 0.17; 95% CI, 0.12-0.23). Females had a lower risk of contracting COVID-19 than males (ARR 0.70; 95% CI, 0.52-0.93). The absolute risk reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 9.7%. Only 1.8% of the participants reported adverse events, which were mild and self-limiting. Conclusion Two doses of oral ivermectin (300 μg/kg/dose given 72 hours apart) as chemoprophylaxis among HCWs reduced the risk of COVID-19 infection by 83% in the following month. Safe, effective, and low-cost chemoprophylaxis has relevance in the containment of pandemic alongside vaccine.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Structure-based identification of SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors from anti-viral specific chemical libraries: an exhaustive computational screening approach,"Worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is still threatening global health since its outbreak first reported in the late 2019. The causative novel virus has been designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although COVID-19 emergent with significant mortality, there is no availability of definite treatment measures. It is now extremely desirable to identify potential chemical entities against SARS-CoV-2 for the treatment of COVID-19. In the present study, a state-of-art virtual screening protocol was implemented on three anti-viral specific chemical libraries against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). Particularly, viewing the large-scale biological role of Mpro in the viral replication process it has been considered as a prospective anti-viral drug target. Herein, on collected 79,892 compounds, hierarchical multistep docking followed by relative binding free energy estimation has been performed. Thereafter, implying a user-defined XP-dock and MM-GBSA cut-off scores as -8.00 and -45.00 kcal/mol, chemical space has been further reduced. Exhaustive molecular binding interactions analyses and various pharmacokinetics profiles assessment suggested four compounds (ChemDiv_D658-0159, ChemDiv_F431-0433, Enamine_Z3019991843 and Asinex_LAS_51389260) as potent inhibitors/modulators of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. In-depth protein-ligand interactions stability in the dynamic state has been evaluated by 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies along with MM-GBSA-based binding free energy estimations of entire simulation trajectories that have revealed strong binding affinity of all identified compounds towards Mpro. Hence, all four identified compounds might be considered as promising candidates for future drug development specifically targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro; however, they also need experimental assessment for a better understanding of molecular interaction mechanisms.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Zero-Inflated Time Series Modelling of COVID-19 Deaths in Ghana,"Discrete count time series data with an excessive number of zeros have warranted the development of zero-inflated time series models to incorporate the inflation of zeros and the overdispersion that comes with it. In this paper, we investigated the characteristics of the trend of daily count of COVID-19 deaths in Ghana using zero-inflated models. We envisaged that the trend of COVID-19 deaths per day in Ghana portrays a general increase from the onset of the pandemic in the country to about day 160 after which there is a general decrease onward. We fitted a zero-inflated Poisson autoregressive model and zero-inflated negative binomial autoregressive model to the data in the partial-likelihood framework. The zero-inflated negative binomial autoregressive model outperformed the zero-inflated Poisson autoregressive model. On the other hand, the dynamic zero-inflated Poisson autoregressive model performed better than the dynamic negative binomial autoregressive model. The predicted new death based on the zero-inflated negative binomial autoregressive model indicated that Ghana's COVID-19 death per day will rise sharply few days after 30(th) November 2020 and drastically fall just as in the observed data.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Opportunities and challenges of using metagenomic data to bring uncultured microbes into cultivation,"Although there is now an extensive understanding of the diversity of microbial life on earth through culture-independent metagenomic DNA sequence analyses, the isolation and cultivation of microbes remains critical to directly study them and confirm their metabolic and physiological functions, and their ecological roles. The majority of environmental microbes are as yet uncultured however; therefore, bringing these rare or poorly characterized groups into culture is a priority to further understand microbiome functions. Moreover, cultivated isolates may find utility in a range of applications, such as new probiotics, biocontrol agents, and agents for industrial processes. The growing abundance of metagenomic and meta-transcriptomic sequence information from a wide range of environments provides more opportunities to guide the isolation and cultivation of microbes of interest. In this paper, we discuss a range of successful methodologies and applications that have underpinned recent metagenome-guided isolation and cultivation of microbe efforts. These approaches include determining specific culture conditions to enrich for taxa of interest, to more complex strategies that specifically target the capture of microbial species through antibody engineering and genome editing strategies. With the greater degree of genomic information now available from uncultivated members, such as via metagenome-assembled genomes, the theoretical understanding of their cultivation requirements will enable greater possibilities to capture these and ultimately gain a more comprehensive understanding of the microbiomes.

Consequences of COVID-19 Lockdown on Children and Their Pets: Dangerous Increase of Dog Bites among the Paediatric Population,"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has not only put our national health systems to the test, but it also notably hit the economy, the society and the psychology of the people. Our pets have been subjected to the pandemic related stress too. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether the stress induced on domestic dogs resulted in an increase of dog bites in the paediatric population. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on all patients admitted to our paediatric emergency department for dog bite from January 2014 and December 2020. We compared the total mean dog bites of the years 2014–2019 and the mean number per single month with the respective 2020 data. The bites were divided between bites from family dogs and bites from stranger dogs. Continuous data were analysed using single sample t test while categorical values with chi-squared test, considering statistically significant a p value < 0.05. Results: From January 2014 to December 2019, we recorded a mean of 41 ± 5.9 dog bites (range: 30–46) of which a mean 13 ± 2.6 (range: 10–17) were due to family dogs (32%) and a mean of 28 ± 2.4 (range: 25–31) were due to stranger dogs (68%); the male-to-female ratio was 3:2 and 43% of the injuries concerned the head and face, 26% the lower limbs, 25% the upper limbs, 3% the genitalia and 3% the torso. From January 2020 to December 2020, 30 children were admitted for dog bites: 22 were from family dogs (73%) and 8 from stranger dogs (27%); the male-to-female ratio was 14:11 and 72% of the injuries concerned the head and face, 16% the upper limbs, 8% the lower limbs and 4% the torso. The 2020 data’s higher number of family dog bites compared with the mean of those in the 2014–2019 period was statistically significant (p < 0.01) such as the 2020 data’s lower number of stranger dog bites when compared with the mean number of stranger dog bites in the 2014–2019 period (p < 0.01). Between 2014 and 2019, a mean of 9 ± 2 (range: 6–12) of the wounds needed to be sutured (22%), while 32 ± 3 (range: 28–35) wounds were discharged after application of Steri Strips (78%). On the other hand, in 2020, 21 wounds needed to be sutured (70%), and 9 received just Steri Strips application (41%). The frequency distribution of the treatments required (stitches vs. Steri Strips) between the 2014 to 2019 period and the 2020 period was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: The number of family dog bites in children increased in 2020, especially during the lockdown period. Paediatricians should pay a lot of attention now more than ever to educate parents on the importance of always supervising children who are playing with dogs.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Exosomal circRELL1 serves as a miR-637 sponge to modulate gastric cancer progression via regulating autophagy activation,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a vital role in the occurrence and development of tumors, including gastric cancer (GC). However, there are still many circRNAs related to GC whose functions and molecular mechanisms remain undetermined. Herein, we discover circRNA RELL1, which has not been investigated in GC, and it is markedly downregulated in GC tissues, which is related with poor prognosis, more pronounced lymph node metastasis and poor TNM stage. After confirming the circular structure of circRELL1, we found that circRELL1 could block cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and anti-apoptosis in patients with GC by a series of in vivo and in vitro function-related studies. Further mechanism investigation demonstrated that circRELL1 could sponge miR-637 and indirectly unregulated the expression of EPHB3 via modulating autophagy activation in GC. Additionally, circRELL1 can be transmitted by exosomal communication, and exosomal circRELL1 suppressed the malignant behavior of GC in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, this study elucidates the suppressive roles of circRELL1/miR-637/EPHB3 axis through autophagy activation in GC progression, inspiring for further understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of GC and providing a promising novel diagnostic circulating biomarker and therapeutic target in GC.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Paediatric plastic bronchitis in an atopic child; A case report from East Africa,Paediatric plastic bronchitis (PB) is a rare disease characterized by the presence or expectoration of branching airway casts usually in children with cardiac conditions and allergy. It is thought to be due to obstruction or altered drainage of the lymphatics in those with cardiac conditions. Obstruction can be diffuse and thus fatal if untreated. Less than 600 cases have been described in literature and just one in our region in a patient with sickle cell disease. We present a case of a 7-year-old female with acute symptoms suggestive of a lower respiratory tract infection and left hemithorax opacification and bronchial casts on bronchoscopy.,Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Predicting the Effectiveness of Endemic Infectious Disease Control Interventions: The Impact of Mass Action versus Network Model Structure.,"BACKGROUND Analyses of the effectiveness of infectious disease control interventions often rely on dynamic transmission models to simulate intervention effects. We aim to understand how the choice of network or compartmental model can influence estimates of intervention effectiveness in the short and long term for an endemic disease with susceptible and infected states in which infection, once contracted, is lifelong. METHODS We consider 4 disease models with different permutations of socially connected network versus unstructured contact (mass-action mixing) model and heterogeneous versus homogeneous disease risk. The models have susceptible and infected populations calibrated to the same long-term equilibrium disease prevalence. We consider a simple intervention with varying levels of coverage and efficacy that reduces transmission probabilities. We measure the rate of prevalence decline over the first 365 d after the intervention, long-term equilibrium prevalence, and long-term effective reproduction ratio at equilibrium. RESULTS Prevalence declined up to 10% faster in homogeneous risk models than heterogeneous risk models. When the disease was not eradicated, the long-term equilibrium disease prevalence was higher in mass-action mixing models than in network models by 40% or more. This difference in long-term equilibrium prevalence between network versus mass-action mixing models was greater than that of heterogeneous versus homogeneous risk models (less than 30%); network models tended to have higher effective reproduction ratios than mass-action mixing models for given combinations of intervention coverage and efficacy. CONCLUSIONS For interventions with high efficacy and coverage, mass-action mixing models could provide a sufficient estimate of effectiveness, whereas for interventions with low efficacy and coverage, or interventions in which outcomes are measured over short time horizons, predictions from network and mass-action models diverge, highlighting the importance of sensitivity analyses on model structure. HIGHLIGHTS • We calibrate 4 models-socially connected network versus unstructured contact (mass-action mixing) model and heterogeneous versus homogeneous disease risk-to 10% preintervention disease prevalence.• We measure the short- and long-term intervention effectiveness of all models using the rate of prevalence decline, long-term equilibrium disease prevalence, and effective reproduction ratio.• Generally, in the short term, prevalence declined faster in the homogeneous risk models than in the heterogeneous risk models.• Generally, in the long term, equilibrium disease prevalence was higher in the mass-action mixing models than in the network models, and the effective reproduction ratio was higher in network models than in the mass-action mixing models.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Ex Ante Knowledge for Infectious Disease Outbreaks: Introducing the Organizational Network Governance Approach,"In our paper we investigate to what extent ex ante knowledge about a response network can be made available in order to deal with a crisis such as an infectious disease outbreak. Outbreaks are almost by definition characterized by a lack of information and knowledge. We introduce the organizational network governance approach for producing information prior to an actual outbreak, which is useful in limiting a virus’s transmission and impact. By introducing two fictitious but realistic outbreak scenarios—the outbreak of the West Nile Virus (WNV) and the outbreak of a New Asian Coronavirus (NAC) in the Netherlands—we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. We formulate recommendations how to use the generated information to strengthen the organizational context in order to limit a virus’s transmission and impact and how to further develop the organizational network governance approach. We also formulate recommendations for how to further develop the organizational network governance approach.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Accurate Prediction Using Triangular Type-2 Fuzzy Linear Regression,"Many works have been done to handle the uncertainties in the data using type 1 fuzzy regression. Few type 2 fuzzy regression works used interval type 2 for indeterminate modeling using type 1 fuzzy membership. The current survey proposes a triangular type-2 fuzzy regression (TT2FR) model to ameliorate the efficiency of the model by handling the uncertainty in the data. The triangular secondary membership function is used instead of widely used interval type models. In the proposed model, vagueness in primary and secondary fuzzy sets is minimized and also, a specified x-plane of observed value is included in the same α- plane of the predicted value. Complex calculations of the type-2 fuzzy (T2F) model are simplified by reducing three dimensional type-2 fuzzy set (3DT2FS) into two dimensional interval type-2 fuzzy (2DIT2F) models. The current survey presents a new regression model of T2F by considering the more general form of T2F membership functions and thus avoids high complexity. The performance of the developed model is evaluated using the TAIEX and COVID-19 forecasting datasets. Our developed model reached the highest performance as compared to the other state-of-art techniques. Our developed method is ready to be tested with more uncertain data and has the potential to use to predict the weather and stock prediction.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Effects of Sialic Acid Modifications on Virus Binding and Infection,"Sialic acids (Sias) are abundantly displayed on the surfaces of vertebrate cells, and particularly on all mucosal surfaces. Sias interact with microbes of many types, and are the targets of specific recognition by many different viruses. They may mediate virus binding and infection of cells, or alternatively can act as decoy receptors that bind virions and block virus infection. These nine-carbon backbone monosaccharides naturally occur in many different modified forms, and are attached to underlying glycans through varied linkages, creating significant diversity in the pathogen receptor forms. Here we review the current knowledge regarding the distribution of modified Sias in different vertebrate hosts, tissues, and cells, their effects on viral pathogens where those have been examined, and outline unresolved questions.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Association of injection Tocilizumab and inflammatory markers in COVID19,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus has spread all over the world. Scientists are trying to discover drugs as effective treatment for patients with COVID-19. So far about 30 drugs have been introduced that one of them is Tocilizumab. Some reports showed a positive effect of Tocilizumab on Saturation of Peripheral Oxygen (SPO2) but results of CT scan in patients in different. In some patients, CT scan showed reduced infiltration, however in other no change was observed. Unfortunately, until now there has been no definitive and effective treatment for patients with COVID-19. Based on evidence of the Tocilizumab's effect on the SARS COV 2, researchers hope this drug will make effective and promising treatment to improve lung tissue inflammation in patients with the fatal COVID-19 virus. The present study provides an overview of respiratory inflammation with COVID-19 and probable effect of Tocilizumab on SARS-COV 2. MATERIAL: A Case Series was conducted on 30 patients, RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases; admitted and kept under observation in medicine ward, ICU or dedicated COVID-19 wards of RNT Medical College and associated group of Hospitals for a duration of 30 days after getting approval from institutional ethics committee if they met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data was collected from records at the time of admission of these cases. OBSERVATION: In our study on day 1 mean of IL6 was 248.3 and on day 3 after giving injection Tocilizumab mean of IL6 was 138.7 and p value was 0.205 and on day1 mean of serum ferritin was 474.2 and on day 3 after giving injection Tocilizumab mean of serum ferritin was 415.2 and p value was 0.649 and on day 1 mean of LDH was 652 and on day 3 after giving injection Tocilizumab mean of LDH was 389.6 and p value was 0.006 and on day 1 mean of CRP was 100 and on day 3 after giving injection Tocilizumab mean of CRP was 35.95 and p value was 0.006 and out of 30 patient 22 patients were discharged and 8 patients declared death. CONCLUSION: In present study it was interpreted that injection Tocilizumab play an important role in reducing inflammation in COVID 19disease. Tocilizumab have significant role in reducing mortality from COVID 19.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Development policy from a systemic perspective: changes, trends and its future role within a broader framework for transnational co-operation","Over the past decade a number of changes can be observed within the development policy system. This paper presents and discusses these changes along three dimensions: narratives, strategies and operational approaches. Changes are manifold, ranging from the application of new narratives, such as the migration narrative, to alternations in strategic objectives (e.g. developing countries’ graduation issues), new instruments (in the form of development finance at the interface with the private sector), and the application of new concepts for project implementation (e.g. through frontier technologies). We discuss the implications and effects of these changes for the current and potential future role of the development policy system, as well as preliminary ideas for a concept of global co-operation for sustainable development (GCSD), spanning beyond the development policy system.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Decrease in sweet taste response and T1R3 sweet taste receptor expression in pregnant mice highlights a potential mechanism for increased caloric consumption in pregnancy.,"While much is known on how the maternal diet affects offspring fitness, less is known on the role of taste in guiding and promoting food intake during this crucial period. Women have intense food cravings and exhibit altered taste preferences during pregnancy, however the mechanistic details underlying these changes during pregnancy are presently unclear. We performed longitudinal brief-access taste testing in female mice before, during, and after pregnancy, along with quantitative PCR on taste buds and morphological analysis of taste tissues from pregnant and non-pregnant mice. Sucrose licking response decreased progressively during pregnancy compared to that prior to mating, with partial recovery in the post-partum period. No change in taste morphology was evident between pregnant and non-pregnant mice, however a notable decrease in T1R3 sweet taste receptor expression was recorded in pregnant dams. We conclude that altered taste preferences during pregnancy likely result from changes in the expression profile of taste buds in the mother, which may promote a less healthy diet while expecting.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Extrauterine growth restriction in extremely preterm infants based on the Intergrowth-21st Project Preterm Postnatal Follow-up Study growth charts and the Fenton growth charts,"Growth charts are essential for monitoring the postnatal growth of preterm infants. The preterm postnatal follow-up study (PPFS) of the Intergrowth-21st Project provides new growth standards based on a longitudinal study. This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of extrautrine growth restriction (EUGR) and the associated factors of EUGR in preterm infants, using the PPFS charts and the Fenton charts. Data of 1,356 infants with gestational age (GA) less than 28 weeks from the Korean Neonatal Network were analysed. The prevalence of small for gestational age (SGA) of weight and length was higher with the Intergrowth charts than with the Fenton charts. EUGR in weight and length was more prevalent when using the Fenton charts. Multivariate analysis showed that low GA, high birthweight z score, male, treated patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular haemorrhage and duration of parenteral nutrition (PN) were associated with EUGR in weight by the Intergrowth charts. High birthweight z score, treated PDA and PN duration were associated with EUGR defined by the Fenton charts. Conclusion: Compared to the Fenton charts, SGA was more defined and EUGR was less prevalent in extremely low gestational infants, while EUGR defined by the Intergrowth charts categorized infants with adverse clinical courses more elaborately.

Face Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Network,"During pandemic CoVID 19, people must use face masks in public areas to prevent and reducing the risk of transmission and spread of the virus. Computer Vision can help to monitor the use of face masks based on images captured via CCTV. Several public areas have installed CCTV that can monitor using masks, but too many people in the area would create problems. Face and side masked face detection is a challenge, given the removal of facial features such as the mouth and nose. A previous study built a mask detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based models, which produced high accuracy but was limited to the front face. This research proposed the CNN method to detect masks based on facial images taken from cameras in public areas. Images containing faces from CCTV are segmented, each faces first using the Retina Face. Experiments were carried out on a single face image in mask detection, resulting in an accuracy of 97.33%. These excellent results are not surprising given CNN's ability to recognize patterns. The most important thing is the segmentation of the face region from one image, which is then tested to produce an accuracy of 82.46%. We selected the best configuration from the two experiments, combined into a mask detection from an image containing multiple faces. The results also showed a significant effect between the face detection method and the learning rate value on the accuracy of the mask use detection system, with the best results of 79.45% using the RetinaFace face detection model. © 2021 IEEE.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

The role of NADPH oxidases in infectious and inflammatory diseases,"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (NOX) are enzymes that generate superoxide or hydrogen peroxide from molecular oxygen utilizing NADPH as an electron donor. There are seven enzymes in the NOX family: NOX1-5 and dual oxidase (DUOX) 1–2. NOX enzymes in humans play important roles in diverse biological functions and vary in expression from tissue to tissue. Importantly, NOX2 is involved in regulating many aspects of innate and adaptive immunity, including regulation of type I interferons, the inflammasome, phagocytosis, antigen processing and presentation, and cell signaling. DUOX1 and DUOX2 play important roles in innate immune defenses at epithelial barriers. This review discusses the role of NOX enzymes in normal physiological processes as well as in disease. NOX enzymes are important in autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes and have also been implicated in acute lung injury caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2. Targeting NOX enzymes directly or through scavenging free radicals may be useful therapies for autoimmunity and acute lung injury where oxidative stress contributes to pathology.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Intensive Care Unit-Acquired Weakness: Not Just Another Muscle Atrophying Condition,"Intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW) occurs in critically ill patients stemming from the critical illness itself, and results in sustained disability long after the ICU stay. Weakness can be attributed to muscle wasting, impaired contractility, neuropathy, and major pathways associated with muscle protein degradation such as the ubiquitin proteasome system and dysregulated autophagy. Furthermore, it is characterized by the preferential loss of myosin, a distinct feature of the condition. While many risk factors for ICUAW have been identified, effective interventions to offset these changes remain elusive. In addition, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the long-term, sustained weakness observed in a subset of patients after discharge is minimal. Herein, we discuss the various proposed pathways involved in the pathophysiology of ICUAW, with a focus on the mechanisms underpinning skeletal muscle wasting and impaired contractility, and the animal models used to study them. Furthermore, we will explore the contributions of inflammation, steroid use, and paralysis to the development of ICUAW and how it pertains to those with the corona virus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). We then elaborate on interventions tested as a means to offset these decrements in muscle function that occur as a result of critical illness, and we propose new strategies to explore the molecular mechanisms of ICUAW, including serum-related biomarkers and 3D human skeletal muscle culture models.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
SARS-CoV-2 Is Restricted by Zinc Finger Antiviral Protein despite Preadaptation to the Low-CpG Environment in Humans,"Recent evidence shows that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is sensitive to interferons (IFNs). However, the most effective types of IFNs and the underlying antiviral effectors remain to be defined. Here, we show that zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP), which preferentially targets CpG dinucleotides in viral RNA sequences, restricts SARS-CoV-2. We further demonstrate that ZAP and its cofactors KHNYN and TRIM25 are expressed in human lung cells. Type I, II, and III IFNs all strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 and further induced ZAP expression. Comprehensive sequence analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 and its closest relatives from horseshoe bats showed the strongest CpG suppression among all known human and bat coronaviruses, respectively. Nevertheless, endogenous ZAP expression restricted SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells, particularly upon treatment with IFN-&#945; or IFN-Î³. Both the long and the short isoforms of human ZAP reduced SARS-CoV-2 RNA expression levels, but the former did so with greater efficiency. Finally, we show that the ability to restrict SARS-CoV-2 is conserved in ZAP orthologues of the reservoir bat and potential intermediate pangolin hosts of human coronaviruses. Altogether, our results show that ZAP is an important effector of the innate response against SARS-CoV-2, although this pandemic pathogen emerged from zoonosis of a coronavirus that was preadapted to the low-CpG environment in humans.IMPORTANCE Although interferons inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and have been evaluated for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the most effective types and antiviral effectors remain to be defined. Here, we show that IFN-Î³ is particularly potent in restricting SARS-CoV-2 and in inducing expression of the antiviral factor ZAP in human lung cells. Knockdown experiments revealed that endogenous ZAP significantly restricts SARS-CoV-2. We further show that CpG dinucleotides which are specifically targeted by ZAP are strongly suppressed in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and that the two closest horseshoe bat relatives of SARS-CoV-2 show the lowest genomic CpG content of all coronavirus sequences available from this reservoir host. Nonetheless, both the short and long isoforms of human ZAP reduced SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels, and this activity was conserved in horseshoe bat and pangolin ZAP orthologues. Our findings indicating that type II interferon is particularly efficient against SARS-CoV-2 and that ZAP restricts this pandemic viral pathogen might promote the development of effective immune therapies against COVID-19.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Safety and Health Measures for COVID-19 Transition Period in the Hotel Industry in Spain,"The health crisis caused by the outbreak of the COVID-19 disease has devastated the worldwide hospitality sector. The current situation has led many countries to implement drastic rules to stop the spread of the virus. According to the Spanish health authority decisions need to be made in the context of uncertainty and lack of knowledgeable experiences through a gradual and asymmetric de-escalation process planned in four phases. Although the vast majority of studies refer to economic risks and impacts on tourist flows and economic income, few of them explicitly investigates safety and health measures that hotel managers should implement to their customers. Over a population of 12,740 hotels, 823 Spanish hotel managers have been involved in a participatory study. With the aim of assessing the actions taken to stop the spread of the virus, empirical research was implemented. A model presented four variables and 13 indicators which have been previously tested among hotel managers in the tourism sector. Five conclusions are drawn from the hypotheses: (1) Mass testing surveillance in customers and employees should be quick, affordable, and homogeneous throughout the European Union. (2) Training measures need to be taken by both public authorities and the private sector to reach a knowledgeable crisis management team with high commitment to the customer's health and safety. (3) Protocols established by public authorities should be observed and adjusted gradually not only in hotels but also in tourist arrivals. (4) Healthy measures need to be periodically updated. (5) Each hotel should set up a surveillance process to guarantee the safety to their customers.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Who Wants to Learn English Online for Free?,"This study of demographics is aimed to help LMOOC designers develop courses that are more appealing to prospective learners, and thus fight low completion rate which remains one of the main drawbacks of MOOCs. In addition, as the world battles against the Covid-19 pandemic, looking for alternative learning approaches is unavoidable. The data presented in this paper were collected between 2016 and 2020 by means of a questionnaire that over 29,000 participants completed upon registration. The questionnaire, which included three multiplechoice questions aimed at obtaining responses regarding age, level of education and gender, revealed that most learners were middle-aged adults who held a university degree. In addition, our findings seemed to indicate that female learners are more likely to take the courses than their male counterparts. The aforementioned findings, which provide an insight into the demographics of EFL MOOCs in Spanish-speaking contexts, are a good starting point for further research which could ultimately help educational authorities know the impact of EFL MOOCs and enable the latter to reach a wider audience.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Protocol for a national probability survey using home specimen collection methods to assess prevalence and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibody response,"PURPOSE: The U.S. response to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has been hampered by early and ongoing delays in testing for infection; without data on where infections were occurring and the magnitude of the epidemic, early public health responses were not data-driven. Understanding the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections and immune response is critical to developing and implementing effective public health responses. Most serological surveys have been limited to localities that opted to conduct them and/or were based on convenience samples. Moreover, results of antibody testing might be subject to high false positive rates in the setting of low prevalence of immune response and imperfect test specificity. METHODS: We will conduct a national serosurvey for SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity and immune experience. A probability sample of U.S. addresses will be mailed invitations and kits for the self-collection of anterior nares swab and finger prick dried blood spot specimens. Within each sampled household, one adult 18 years or older will be randomly selected and asked to complete a questionnaire and to collect and return biological specimens to a central laboratory. Nasal swab specimens will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RNA PCR; dried blood spot specimens will be tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., immune experience) by enzyme-linked immunoassays. Positive screening tests for antibodies will be confirmed by a second antibody test with different antigenic basis to improve predictive value of positive (PPV) antibody test results. All persons returning specimens in the baseline phase will be enrolled into a follow-up cohort and mailed additional specimen collection kits 3 months after baseline. A subset of 10% of selected households will be invited to participate in full household testing, with tests offered for all household members aged &#8805;3 years. The main study outcomes will be period prevalence of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and immune experience, and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibody responses. RESULTS: Power calculations indicate that a national sample of 4000 households will facilitate estimation of national SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibody prevalence with acceptably narrow 95% confidence intervals across several possible scenarios of prevalence levels. Oversampling in up to seven populous states will allow for prevalence estimation among subpopulations. Our 2-stage algorithm for antibody testing produces acceptable PPV at prevalence levels &#8805;1.0%. Including oversamples in states, we expect to receive data from as many as 9156 participants in 7495 U.S. households. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to providing robust estimates of prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune experience, we anticipate this study will establish a replicable methodology for home-based SARS-CoV-2 testing surveys, address concerns about selection bias, and improve positive predictive value of serology results. Prevalence estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune experience produced by this study will greatly improve our understanding of the spectrum of COVID-19 disease, its current penetration in various demographic, geographic, and occupational groups, and inform the range of symptoms associated with infection. These data will inform resource needs for control of the ongoing epidemic and facilitate data-driven decisions for epidemic mitigation strategies.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on appropriateness of diagnostic pathways of autoimmune diseases.,"OBJECTIVE Early diagnosis of autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD) is key to achieving effective treatment and improved prognosis. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to major changes in clinical practice on a global scale. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rheumatological clinical practices and autoimmunity testing demands. METHODS Data regarding first rheumatological visits and new diagnosis together with the autoimmunity laboratory testing volumes related to COVID-19 pandemic phase (January- December 2020), were collected from medical records and laboratory information system (LIS) of a regional reference hospital (Basilicata, Italy) and compared with those obtained during the corresponding period in 2019. RESULTS A significant decrease in the 2020 autoimmunity laboratory test volume was found when compared with the same period in 2019 (9912 vs 14100, p<0.05). A significant decrease in first rheumatological visits and diagnosis (1272 vs 2336, p<0.05) was also observed. However, an equivalent or higher percentage of positive autoimmunity results from outpatients services were recorded during 2020 when compared to pre-pandemic state. Of note, COVID- 19 associated decline in new diagnosis mainly affected less severe diseases. In contrast, ARD with systemic involvement were diagnosed at the same levels as the pre-pandemic period. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on the access to health services. However, our study highlighted that during the outbreak, greater appropriateness of the requests of laboratory test and visits emerged as shown by a greater percentage of positive testing results and new diagnosis of more severe ARD compared to pre-pandemic period.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Preoperative incidence and risk factors of deep venous thrombosis in patients with isolated femoral shaft fracture,"BACKGROUND: Preoperative deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities delays surgery in patients with femoral shaft fractures and impairs functional recovery. However, studies on preoperative DVT in patients with femoral shaft fractures are still rare. This study was aimed to retrospectively analyze the preoperative incidence, location and risk factors associated with DVT in patients with femoral shaft fractures. METHODS: Data of patients with femoral shaft fractures and treated with surgery at the Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University were retrospectively collected from January 2013 to December 2019. The information collected included demographic data, comorbidities, injury-related data and laboratory tests. Patients were divided into DVT and non-DVT groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine independent risk factors. RESULTS: A total of 432 patients were included in this study, of whom 114 (26.4%) patients were diagnosed with preoperative DVT (all asymptomatic) and injured extremities of 78.1% (89/114) were investigated. Multivariate analysis showed that older age (increase in each 10 years), delay time from injury to operation (in each day), FIB > 4 g/L were independent risk factors for preoperative DVT. CONCLUSION: Patients with femoral shaft fractures (especially the elderly and patients with the above-mentioned conditions) are at the risk of DVT right from admission to surgery hence should be intensively monitored and provided with prompt treatment to prevent DVT.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Early prone positioning in acute respiratory distress syndrome related to COVID-19: a propensity score analysis from the multicentric cohort COVID-ICU network—the ProneCOVID study,"BACKGROUND: Delaying time to prone positioning (PP) may be associated with higher mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We evaluated the use and the impact of early PP on clinical outcomes in intubated patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) for COVID-19. METHODS: All intubated patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 were involved in a secondary analysis from a prospective multicenter cohort study of COVID-ICU network including 149 ICUs across France, Belgium and Switzerland. Patients were followed-up until Day-90. The primary outcome was survival at Day-60. Analysis used a Cox proportional hazard model including a propensity score. RESULTS: Among 2137 intubated patients, 1504 (70.4%) were placed in PP during their ICU stay and 491 (23%) during the first 24 h following ICU admission. One hundred and eighty-one patients (36.9%) of the early PP group had a PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio > 150 mmHg when prone positioning was initiated. Among non-early PP group patients, 1013 (47.4%) patients had finally been placed in PP within a median delay of 3 days after ICU admission. Day-60 mortality in non-early PP group was 34.2% versus 39.3% in the early PP group (p = 0.038). Day-28 and Day-90 mortality as well as the need for adjunctive therapies was more important in patients with early PP. After propensity score adjustment, no significant difference in survival at Day-60 was found between the two study groups (HR 1.34 [0.96–1.68], p = 0.09 and HR 1.19 [0.998–1.412], p = 0.053 in complete case analysis or in multiple imputation analysis, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In a large multicentric international cohort of intubated ICU patients with ARDS due to COVID-19, PP has been used frequently as a main treatment. In this study, our data failed to show a survival benefit associated with early PP started within 24 h after ICU admission compared to PP after day-1 for all COVID-19 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation regardless of their severity.

COVID-19 Ischemic Strokes as an Emerging Rehabilitation Population: A Case Series,"There is emerging literature that coronavirus disease 2019 infections result in an increased incidence of thrombosis secondary to a prothrombotic state. Initial studies reported ischemic strokes primarily occurring in the critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 population. However, there have been reports of ischemic strokes as the presenting symptom in young noncritically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients without significant risk factors. Further characterization of the coronavirus disease 2019 stroke population is needed. We present four cases of coronavirus disease 2019 ischemic strokes occurring in patients aged 37-68 yrs with varying coronavirus disease 2019 infection severities, premorbid risk factors, clinical presentations (eg, focal and nonfocal), and vascular distributions. These cases highlight the heterogeneity of coronavirus disease 2019 ischemic strokes. The duration of the coronavirus disease 2019-related prothrombotic state is unknown, and it is unclear whether patients are at risk for recurrent strokes. With more coronavirus disease 2019 patients recovering and being discharged to rehabilitation, physiatric awareness of this prothrombotic state and increased incidence of ischemic strokes is essential. Because of the variable presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 ischemic strokes, clinicians can consider neuroimaging as part of the evaluation in coronavirus disease 2019 patients with either acute focal or nonfocal neurologic symptoms. Additional studies are needed to clarify prothrombotic state duration, determine prognosis for recovery, and establish the physiatrist's role in long-term disease management.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Genetic modification to design a stable yeast-expressed recombinant SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain as a COVID-19 vaccine candidate,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has now spread worldwide to infect over 110 million people, with approximately 2.5 million reported deaths. A safe and effective vaccine remains urgently needed. METHOD: We constructed three variants of the recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (residues 331–549) in yeast as follows: (1) a “wild type” RBD (RBD219-WT), (2) a deglycosylated form (RBD219-N1) by deleting the first N-glycosylation site, and (3) a combined deglycosylated and cysteine-mutagenized form (C538A-mutated variant (RBD219-N1C1)). We compared the expression yields, biophysical characteristics, and functionality of the proteins produced from these constructs. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: These three recombinant RBDs showed similar secondary and tertiary structure thermal stability and had the same affinity to their receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), suggesting that the selected deletion or mutations did not cause any significant structural changes or alteration of function. However, RBD219-N1C1 had a higher fermentation yield, was easier to purify, was not hyperglycosylated, and had a lower tendency to form oligomers, and thus was selected for further vaccine development and evaluation. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: By genetic modification, we were able to design a better-controlled and more stable vaccine candidate, which is an essential and important criterion for any process and manufacturing of biologics or drugs for human use.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Gaya Bahasa Repetisi Ustaz Adi Hidayat Tentang Penyelenggaran Ibadah Dalam Wabah COVID-19,"This study examines the style of repetition in Ustaz Adi Hidayat's preach (UAH) related to the socialization of the fatwa of the Indonesian Council of Religious Scholars (MUI) about performing worship during the COVID-19 outbreak. Data of this study were taken from the UAH's lecture which aired via Official Adi Hidayat Youtube account. Data analysis was carried out by transcribing the sermon, marking the information containing repetition and making analyzes. The results of this study conclude that not all forms of repetition styles are presented in UAH's preach, such as epistrophe. The styles of repetition contained in his preach consist of (1) epizeuxis, (2) tautotes, (3) anaphora, (4) symploce, (5) mesodiplosis, (6) epanalepsis, (7) anadiplosis. Besides, the finding also reveals the existence of two repetition styles in one data, namely (1) anaphora and tautotes, (2) epizeuxis and tautotes, and (3) anaphora and mesodiplosis. The styles of repetition used by UAH aim to emphasize the key points of the MUI fatwa so that it can be easily understood by audiences. It is proven by the dominance of the epizeuxis and tautotes style found in this study. The findings of repetition style in spoken discourse will be different from that of written discourse. The repetition style in spoken is spontaneous. Preachers generally develop their style until repetition becomes their characteristic.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

The impact of COVID-19 in policy contexts,"This chapter examines the ways in which EU member states dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic by setting information about the spread of the virus and the mitigation strategies adopted by governments at international, national and local levels in the context of their policy environments and the policymaking process. The chapter looks behind the headlines and statistics to explore the relationship between state power and public attitudes towards government interventions, drawing on data about public trust in politicians and scientists, to identify similarities and differences in policy responses and their impact on social and economic life. Fluctuations in public opinion and perceptions of government interventions are found to affect policy outcomes. The chapter shows how knowledge about the diversity of policy environments, administrative cultures and legislative frameworks in different countries can contribute to a better understanding of the performance of national governments and EU institutions in dealing with COVID-19 and preparing for future outbreaks of the pandemic. The conclusion reviews the impact of the pandemic on administrative structures and legal processes in different policy contexts.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Decline of humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 Spike in convalescent individuals,"In the absence of effective vaccines and with limited therapeutic options, convalescent plasma is being collected across the globe for potential transfusion to COVID-19 patients. The therapy has been deemed safe and several clinical trials assessing its efficacy are ongoing. While it remains to be formally proven, the presence of neutralizing antibodies is thought to play a positive role in the efficacy of this treatment. Indeed, neutralizing titers of ≥1:160 have been recommended in some convalescent plasma trials for inclusion. Here we performed repeated analyses at one-month interval on 31 convalescent individuals to evaluate how the humoral responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike, including neutralization, evolve over time. We observed that receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG slightly decreased between six and ten weeks after symptoms onset but RBD-specific IgM decreased much more abruptly. Similarly, we observed a significant decrease in the capacity of convalescent plasma to neutralize pseudoparticles bearing SARS-CoV-2 S wild-type or its D614G variant. If neutralization activity proves to be an important factor in the clinical efficacy of convalescent plasma transfer, our results suggest that plasma from convalescent donors should be recovered rapidly after symptoms resolution.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Financial implications of fourth industrial revolution: Can bitcoin improve prospects of energy investment?,"Bitcoin and the blockchain technology on which it is based are the key drivers behind the accelerated pace of Fourth Industrial Revolution in the domain of Finance. The offshoots of this technology however are not limited and are rapidly spreading in other domains such as oil market. This paper investigates the causality or influences that both markets, Bitcoin price (BP) and oil price (OP) have on each other by applying the bootstrap Granger causal relationship tests considering full as well as sub-samples. Our analysis reveals that shocks originated in OP and transmitted towards BP can be both positive or negative. The positive impact indicates that Bitcoin can be viewed as an asset helpful in avoiding the risks of the high OP, which also indicates that Bitcoin and oil are in the same boat, however, the negative effects cannot support this view. The negative influence of OP on BP can be explained by the burst of the Bitcoin bubble which has weakened its hedging ability. In turn, there is also a negative influence or reverse causality running from BP to OP, highlighting that the demand for oil by investors can be threatened by the increasing BP. Keeping in view the more integrated and complexed financial dynamics which are the results of Fourth Industrial Revolution, investors can benefit from this interrelationship to diversify the risks and optimize their investment by building a more balanced portfolio. Also, governments could promote and protect the healthy development of the Bitcoin and energy market by preventing the Bitcoin bubbles and understanding the reasons of oil price volatility.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
COVID-19 pandemic and stability of stock market-A sectoral approach,"The COVID-19 pandemic seems to be the most important phenomenon observed from March 2020 in virtually all countries of the world. The necessity to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and keep health care systems efficient resulted in the forced, drastic limitation of economic activity. Many service sectors were hit particularly hard with this but industry and agriculture were also affected. In particular, the pandemic substantially influenced financial markets and we can observe that some markets or instruments vary in stability since they have been affected in the different degree. In the paper, we present the problem of stability of stock markets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the low number of works related to CEE countries during the pandemic, we analyze the Warsaw Stock Exchange, which is one of the most important markets in the CEE. Our main goal was to find how various industries represented by stock market indices have reacted to the COVID-19 shock and consequently which sectors turned out to keep stability and remained resistant to the pandemic. In our investigation, we use two clustering methods: the K-means and the Ward techniques with the criterion of maximizing the silhouette coefficient and six indicators describing stability in terms of profitability, volume, overbought/oversold conditions and volatility. The results of the research present that during the pandemic it was possible to identify 5 clusters of sector indices in the short term and 4 in the medium term. We found that the composition of the clusters is quite stable over time and that none of the obtained clusters can be univocally considered the most or the least stable taking into account all the analyzed indicators. However, we showed that the obtained clusters have different stability origins, i.e. they vary from each other in terms of the investigated indicators of stability.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis as the Presenting Manifestation of Relapsed Classic Hodgkin's Lymphoma in the Presence of Concurrent Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Genital Herpes, Epstein-Barr Virus and Mycobacterium Avium Complex Infection","Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a life-threatening disorder of uncontrolled immune activation which is usually divided into two main types Primary, which is associated with genetic mutation and familial predisposition and secondary, which is usually associated with infections, malignancies and autoimmune conditions More often multiple risk factors are present at the time of initial presentation We report a case where HLH was the presenting manifestation of relapsed Classic Hodgkin's Lymphoma in the presence of multiple risk factors of secondary HLH such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active genital herpes, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection and prior chemotherapy A 38-year-old male to female transgender woman presented with one-week history of fever, nausea, vomiting and generalized weakness The past medical history was significant for HIV and previously treated and positron emission tomography (PET) scan confirmed complete remission of Classic Hodgkin's Lymphoma Physical examination showed BP 92/40 mmHg, fever of 102 6 F, heart rate of 114 beats per minutes, diffuse abdominal tenderness and male genitalia with multiple small ulcerative lesions Labs showed pancytopenia, hyponatremia, mildly elevated total and direct bilirubin, transaminitis, CD-4 count 96/mcL, HIV viral load undetectable and COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative Imaging showed right middle lung lobe consolidation and hepatosplenomegaly with multiple hypodense lesions Lymphadenopathy was reported in mediastinum and retroperitoneum The patient was initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, IV fluids, vasopressors and stress dose steroids After initial improvement, vasopressors and steroids were stopped The patient again started spiking fever on day 9 despite being on antibiotics Workup showed EBV viremia, genital herpes and evidence of MAC infection on sputum culture No improvement noted despite appropriate treatment for genital herpes and MAC Additional lab work showed hyperferritinemia and elevated soluble Interleukin-2 receptors The patient was diagnosed with HLH as per HLH-2004 criteria and treated with dexamethasone and etoposide Bone marrow biopsy confirmed hemophagocytosis and immunoperoxidase staining established the diagnosis of relapsed Classic Hodgkin's Lymphoma We can conclude that in patients with a history of hematological malignancy presenting with HLH, a high degree of suspicion for relapse should be maintained even in the presence of other risk factors",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

A Randomized Controlled Study of Muscle Training Exercise Based Pulmonary Rehabilitation on Activity of Daily Living in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019,"Background: Hospitalized patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia showed a severve loss of muscle mass and strength over admission. Therefore, early physical interventions might be conducive to prevent disability and fasten recovery. Methods: : We designed a prospective, randomized controlled trial to identify the effectiveness and safety of pulmonary rehabilitation based on muscle exercise in COVID-19 patients. The study was conducted between February 7 th and March 31 st 2020 in Union Hospital. Patients were randomly assigned to the pulmonary rehabilitation exercise group or the control group. Primary outcome was improvement of activity of daily living (ADL). Secondary outcome was changes of muscle strength assessed by manual muscle test (MMT) and arterial blood gas analysis. Length of hospital staying (LOS) and adverse events related to physical activity were also observed. Results: : A total of sixty patients were in analysis, and thirty patients were in PR group. Patients had a mean age of 54.43±10.57 years. A statistically and clinically significant increase in ADL was observed in PR group (75.00 [66.25,90.00] to 100.00 [100.00,100.00], p<0.001). We also found that the improvement of ADL was related to younger age and higher PaO 2 (p<0.01). Both groups had MMT improvement and there was no statistical difference between groups. There was a significant increase in PaO 2 (80.23±6.49 vs. 90.47±7.82, respectively, p<0.001) between two groups before discharge. There was no statically significant difference in LOS between study group and control group (p=0.62). None of these patients had severe complications during the study. Conclusions: : The protocal of pulmonary rehabilitation based on muscle training exercise was feasible in COVID-19 patients and it might accelerate recovery in ADL as compared with the spontaneous recovery in the control group.

"Effects of modified-Paleo and moderate-carbohydrate diets on body composition, serum levels of hepatokines and adipocytokines, and flow cytometric analysis of endothelial microparticles in adults with metabolic syndrome: a study protocol for a randomized clinical trial","BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome is a combination of metabolic risk factors causing a pathological condition that increases the risk of non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. A variety of dietary approaches have been examined to halt this rapid trend; however, the effects of modified-Paleo diet and medium-carbohydrate diet on inflammation, adipokines, hepatokines, and the profile of endothelial microparticles in individuals with metabolic syndrome have not been investigated in detail. The present study is designed to examine the effect of modified-Paleo and moderate-carbohydrate diet with two delivery modes: “fixed diet plan” vs “calorie counting” on weight, body composition, serum levels of some hepatokines and adipocytokines, and flow cytometric analysis of endothelial microparticles in adults with metabolic syndrome. METHODS: Eighty metabolic syndrome patients will be recruited in this study. They will be randomly allocated to one of the following 4 groups: (1) receiving a modified-Paleo diet with calorie counting, (2) receiving a modified-Paleo diet with a fixed diet plan, (3) receiving a medium-carbohydrate diet with calorie counting, and (4) receiving a medium-carbohydrate diet with a fixed diet plan for 10 weeks. Weight, height, waist circumference, and body composition will be assessed at the study baseline and at the end of the trial. Serum insulin, asprosin, chemerin, FGF-21, CTRP-1, PYY, ghrelin, plasma EMPs (CD31+/CD42b− and CD144+/CD42b−), lipid profile, glycemic indices, hs-CRP, leptin, vitamin C, creatinine and satiety, hunger, fullness, and desire to eat (via visual analog scales) will be measured at the study baseline and at the end of the trial. Insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity will be determined using the HOMA-IR and QUICKI equations. DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial that will determine the effect of modified-Paleo and moderate-carbohydrate diet on weight, body composition, serum levels of some hepatokines and adipocytokines, and the profile of EMPs in adults with metabolic syndrome. Moreover, the effects of different diet delivery modes, including “fixed diet plan” and “calorie counting” will also be analyzed. The results of this trial can provide clinical witnesses on the effectiveness of carbohydrate-restricted diets in ameliorating metabolic status and prevent the development of chronic diseases.

Preparation for and organization during a major incident,"Major incidents during the recent past have reinforced the value that the NHS and other agencies have invested into the comprehensive Emergency, Preparedness, Resilience and Response framework. This gives a detailed structure of the role of the NHS in any type of major incident from man-made disaster to pandemic flu. This has required preparation of communication, transport, security, military and healthcare systems. Also included is how the response to the incident is handled at a local level and for different levels of response. Examples of how this has played out are described. Specialist training at the higher and advanced level for trainees is established so that victims are triaged at the scene and received by consultants with appropriate training. Hospitals, ambulance services and intensive care units across the country can use networks to ensure not only rapid access to Major Trauma Centres but also to highly sophisticated skills when advanced life support is required.

The Experiences of Intensive Care Nurses in Advocacy of COVID-19 Patients,"The lack of face-to-face interactions with families, the increase in the number of patients admitted to the ICU, nursing staff shortages, and inadequate personal protective equipment has created many challenges for nurses in advocacy of the COVID-19 patient with life-threatening conditions. This study aimed to explore the experiences of intensive care nurses in the advocacy of COVID-19 patients. This study was performed using a qualitative content analysis method with Graneheim and Lundman approach, Iran, 2020. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with eighteen clinical nurses from the intensive care units of three hospitals. Themes extracted from the nurses’ statements were promoting patient safety (informing physicians about the complications and consequences of treatment, preventing medical errors, protecting patients from threats), respecting the patients’ values (providing comfort at the end of life, providing a comfortable environment, commitment to confidentiality, cultural observance, respect for individualism, fair care), and informing (clarifying clinical conditions, describing available services, and being the patients’ voice). ICU nurses in health crises such as COVID-19 as patient advocates should promote patient safety, respect patients’ values, and inform them. The results of this study could help enhance the active role of intensive care nurses in the advocacy of COVID-19 patients.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Performance assessment of face analysis algorithms with occluded faces,"In retail environments, it is important to acquire information about customers entering in a selling area, by counting them, but also by understanding stable traits (such as gender, age, or ethnicity) and temporary feelings (such as the emotion). Anyway, in the last year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is becoming mandatory to wear a mask, covering at least half of the face, thus making the above mentioned face analysis tasks definitely more challenging. In this paper, we evaluate the drop in the performance of these analytics when the face is partially covered by a mask, in order to evaluate how existing face analysis applications can perform with occluded faces. According to our knowledge, this is the first time a similar analysis has been performed. Furthermore, we also propose two new datasets, designed as extensions with masked faces of the widely adopted VGG-Face and RAF-DB datasets, that we make publicly available for benchmarking purposes. The analysis we conducted demonstrates that, except for gender and ethnicity recognition whose accuracy drop is quite limited (less than 10%), further investigations are necessary for increasing the performance of methods for age estimation (MAE drop between 4 and 10 years) and emotion recognition (accuracy decrease between 45% and 55%). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Profiles of liver function abnormalities in elderly patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019,"BACKGROUND: The profiles of liver function abnormalities in COVID-19 patients need to be clarified. METHODS: In this retrospective study, consecutive COVID-19 patients over 60 years old in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 1 to Feb 6 were included. Data of demographics, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory tests, medications and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Sequential alterations of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were monitored. RESULTS: 330 patients were included and classified into two groups with normal (n=234) or elevated ALT (n=96). There were fewer females (40.6% vs 54.7%, P=0.020) and more critical cases (30.2% vs. 19.2%, P=0.026) in patients with elevated ALT compared to the normal group. Higher levels of bacterial infection indices (e.g. white blood cell count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin) were observed in the elevated group. Spearman correlation showed that both ALT and AST levels were positively correlated with those indices of bacterial infection. No obvious effects of medications on ALT abnormalities were found. In patients with elevated ALT, most ALT elevations were mild and transient. 59.4% of the patients had ALT concentrations of 41-100 U/L, while only a few patients (5.2%) had high serum ALT concentrations above 300 U/L. ALT elevations occurred at 13 (10-17) days and recovered at 28 (18-35) days from disease onset. For most patients, the elevation of serum ALT levels occurred at 6-20 days after disease onset and reached their peak values within a similar time frame. The recovery of serum ALT levels to normal frequently occurred at 16-20 days or 31-35 days after disease onset. CONCLUSIONS: Liver function abnormalities were observed in 29.1% of the elderly COVID-19 patients, which were slightly and transient in most cases. Liver function abnormalities in COVID-19 may be correlated with bacterial infection.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Polymorphisms in alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene, CHRNA7, and its partially duplicated gene, CHRFAM7A, associate with increased inflammatory response in human peripheral mononuclear cells.","The vagus nerve can, via the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR), regulate inflammation. The gene coding for the α7nAChR, CHRNA7, can be partially duplicated, that is, CHRFAM7A, which is reported to impair the anti-inflammatory effect mediated via the α7nAChR. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been described in both CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A, however, the functional role of these SNPs for immune responses remains to be investigated. In the current study, we set out to investigate whether genetic variants of CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A can influence immune responses. By investigating data available from the Swedish SciLifeLab SCAPIS Wellness Profiling (S3WP) study, in combination with droplet digital PCR and freshly isolated PBMCs from the S3WP participants, challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we show that CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A are expressed in human PBMCs, with approximately four times higher expression of CHRFAM7A compared with CHRNA7. One SNP in CHRFAM7A, rs34007223, is positively associated with hsCRP in healthy individuals. Furthermore, gene ontology (GO)-terms analysis of plasma proteins associated with gene expression of CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A demonstrated an involvement for these genes in immune responses. This was further supported by in vitro data showing that several SNPs in both CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A are significantly associated with cytokine response. In conclusion, genetic variants of CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A alters cytokine responses. Furthermore, given that CHRFAM7A SNP rs34007223 is associated with inflammatory marker hsCRP in healthy individuals suggests that CHRFAM7A may have a more pronounced role in regulating inflammatory processes in humans than previously been recognized.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Learning Remotely during a Pandemic: Are Students in a Developing Country Fully Equipped with Tools for Swift Changes?,"Many higher educational institutes are forced to the online mode of lecture delivery without fully understanding students’ perspectives of remote study during COVID-19, and the resource limitations of students to engage successfully in remote learning. The present study aimed to understand this gap and the students’ perspective. We collected and analysed the devices, which used by the students to connect to remote learning in a developing country. It was found that the majority of students are dependent on the laptop-smartphone combination to engage in remote learning, particularly the students in rural areas. The results highlighted the importance of smartphones in the online learning experience, considering their affordability, relatively long battery life, inbuilt internet capabilities, and portability. Although students indicated their willingness for remote learning, they clearly recognised the need for face-to-face teaching return to avoid some of the challenges and disadvantages they face as a part of remote learning.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Impact of COVID-19 on UK stress echocardiography practice: insights from the EVAREST sites,"Healthcare delivery is being transformed by COVID-19 to reduce transmission risk but continued delivery of routine clinical tests is essential. Stress echocardiography is one of the most widely used cardiac tests in the NHS. We assessed the impact of the first (W1) and second (W2) waves of the pandemic on ability to deliver stress echocardiography. Clinical echocardiography teams in 31 NHS hospitals participating in the EVAREST study were asked in July and November 2020 to complete a survey on the structure and delivery of stress echocardiography as well as impact on patients and staff. Results were compared to stress echocardiography activity in the same centre during January 2020. 24 and 19 NHS hospitals completed the survey in July and November, respectively. A 55% reduction in the number of studies performed was reported in W1, recovering to exceed pre-COVID rates in W2. The major change was in mode of stress delivery. 70% of sites stopped their exercise stress service in W1, compared to 19% in W2. In those still using exercise during W1, 50% were wearing FFP3/N95 masks, falling to 38% in W2. There was also significant variability in patient screening practices with 7 different pre-screening questionnaires used in W1 and 6 in W2. Stress echocardiography delivery restarted effectively after COVID-19 with adaptations to reduce transmission that means activity has been able to continue, and exceed, pre-COVID-19 levels during the second wave. Further standardisation of protocols for patient screening and PPE may help further improve consistency of practice within the UK.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Inflammatory cytokines in pediatric obstructive sleep apnea.,"Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with chronic systemic inflammation and with cognitive impairments. This study aimed to investigate the status of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin 17 (IL-17) and interleukin 23 (IL-23) and cognition in pediatric OSA.Controls and OSA children participated in the study. Exclusion criteria were adenotonsillectomy, heart, neurological and severe psychiatric diseases, craniofacial syndromes, and obesity. Polysomnogram was followed by serum testing for inflammatory markers and neurocognitive tests such as continuous performance task (CPT) and Wisconsin card sorting test, questionnaires, analyses of plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HS-CRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-17, and IL-23.Seventy-nine, 4 to 12-year-old subjects in 2 groups ended the study: 47 nonobese OSA children (mean age = 7.84 ± 0.56 years, body mass index [BMI] = 16.95 ± 0.47 kg/m, BMI z-score = 0.15 ± 0.21, and mean apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] = 9.13 ± 1.67 events/h) and 32 healthy control children (mean age = 7.02 ± 0.65 years, with BMI = 16.55 ± 0.58 kg/m, BMI z-score = -0.12 ± 0.27, and mean AHI = 0.41 ± 0.07 event/h) were enrolled. Serum cytokine analyses showed significantly higher levels of HS-CRP, IL-17, and IL-23 in OSA children (P = 0.002, P = 0.024, and P = 0.047). Regression test showed significant influence of HS-CRP, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-17, and specifically IL-23, with the continuous performance test and Wisconsin card sorting test.OSA children have abnormal levels of IL-17, an interleukin related to T helper 17 cells, a T helper cell involved in development of autoimmunity and inflammation. This high expression level may contribute to the complications of pediatric OSA; we also found a significant influence of inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-23, on abnormal neurocognitive testing.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Impact de l’épidémie de COVID-19 lors de la 1ère vague sur les patients de la cohorte PSOBIOTEQ traités pour psoriasis cutané,"Introduction La propagation de COVID-19 a amené la France à se confiner une 1ère fois du 17 mars au 11 mai 2020. Cette maladie potentiellement grave a confronté les patients atteints de psoriasis et recevant un traitement systémique, ainsi que leurs médecins, à de nombreuses incertitudes qui ont pu conduire à des modifications de leur traitement de fond. L’objectif de cette étude était d’évaluer les facteurs associés à une modification (arrêt, diminution de dose, espacement) du traitement systémique des patients au cours de la 1ère vague. Matériel et méthodes Étude ancillaire de la cohorte PSOBIOTEQ, portant sur les patients psoriasiques inclus avant le confinement et recevant un traitement systémique. Une enquête spécifique sur COVID-19 a été menée du 1er juin au 31 décembre portant sur la 1ère vague. L’analyse des facteurs associés à une modification du traitement systémique a été réalisée en uni et multivariée. Résultats Au total, 1664 patients (âge médian : 49 ans ; femmes : 37,4 %) ont été inclus dont 631 (37,4 %) provenaient de régions à forte incidence de COVID-19. Les patients étaient sous le même traitement depuis une durée médiane de 20 mois avant le confinement. Le nombre de cas suspectés/confirmés incidents de COVID-19 était de 43 (2,9 %). Au total, 282 (16,9 %) patients ont modifié leur traitement. Cette modification a été décidée par le patient (46,0 %), recommandée par un médecin généraliste (14,0 %), un dermatologue (16,2 %) ou était liée à un problème d’accès aux soins (ex: consultation annulée ou rupture de stock en pharmacie) (18,0 %). Parmi les patients ayant modifié leur traitement, 155 (58,7 %) ont eu une poussée de psoriasis au cours du confinement vs 189 (14,4 %) chez les patients ne l’ayant pas modifié (p <0,0001). Aucune différence n’a été observée concernant les précautions vis-à-vis de COVID-19 pendant le 1er confinement entre les deux groupes. En analyse multivariée, les facteurs associés à une modification du traitement étaient : avoir une maladie cardiovasculaire (Odds ratio (OR) IC95 % 0,5 [0,3 ;0,7], p <0,001), un diabète (OR IC95% 0,5 [0,2 ;1,1], p =0,049) et le fait de consommer de l’alcool (OR IC95% 1,7 [1,1 ;2,6], p =0,007). Discussion L’épidémie de COVID-19 a provoqué une modification des traitements systémiques lors de la 1ère vague parmi 16,9 % des patients de la cohorte–principalement décidée par les patients eux-mêmes–et entraînant des poussées de psoriasis. Les patients avec des comorbidités, facteurs de risque de formes graves de COVID-19, ont moins fréquemment modifié leur traitement systémique. En revanche, la consommation d’alcool était un facteur associé à une modification du traitement systémique. Le type de traitement de fond n’était pas retenu par le modèle. Ces résultats nous incitent à une meilleure anticipation sur l’information des patients et la continuité des soins en cas de crise sanitaire.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Evidence for Increased Susceptibility for Breast Cancer from Exposure to Ionizing Radiation Due to Familial Breast Cancer History: Results from the Swedish Hemangioma Cohort.,"Women with breast cancer among family members are at increased risk for breast cancer. However, it is unknown whether familial breast cancer history (FBCH) also increases individual susceptibility for breast cancer from radiation exposure. In this cohort study, 17,200 female Swedish hemangioma patients with 1,079 breast cancer cases between 1958-2013, exposed by ionizing radiation in infancy, were linked to their first-degree relatives. The association between FBCH and radiation-induced breast cancer risk was assessed. Further, the relevance for breast cancer radiotherapy and mammography screening was evaluated. On average, the radiation-induced excess relative (ERR) and absolute risk (EAR) at age 50 was ERR = 0.51 Gy-1 (95%CI: 0.33; 0.71), and EAR = 10.8 (104 PYR Gy)-1 (95%CI: 7.0; 14.6). Radiation risk was higher by a factor of 2.7 (95%CI: 1.0; 4.8, P = 0.05) if one first-degree relative was affected with breast cancer. For whole breast standard radiotherapy at age 40 with a contralateral breast dose of 0.72 Gy, the 20-year radiation-related excess contralateral breast cancer risk was estimated to increase from 0.6% for women without FBCH to 1.7% with FBCH. For biennial mammography screening program between 40-74 years of age, radiation risk until age 80 would increase from 0.11% for women without FBCH to 0.29% with FBCH.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

How effective are the COVID-19 vaccines? A Bayesian analysis,"This short paper reports a Bayesian analysis of the publicly available COVID-19 trial results. The analysis casts some doubts on whether the half+full dose regime of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is truly (much) more effective than the 2x full dose regime. The 95% posterior interval for the effectiveness of the half+full dose regime is 66-96%, while for the 2x full dose regime it is 39-74%. The estimated effectiveness for the Pfizer vaccine is 89-97% and for Moderna 86-97%. These results should be interpreted with care though, since this analysis does not account for differences in for instance trial population, COVID-19 testing, and storage requirements for the various vaccines.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
ARIMA-based forecasting of total COVID-19 cases in the USA and India,"The coronavirus pandemic first started in Wuhan, China. The pandemic then spread rapidly all over the world. The virus wreaked unprecedented havoc worldwide. Researchers are using a variety of mathematical and machine learning-based prediction models to predict the future trend of the pandemic. In this study, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were developed to forecast the expected daily confirmed COVID-19 cases for the next two weeks in the United States (USA) and India, which are most affected by the pandemic. ARIMA (0,2,1) and ARIMA (1,2,3) models with the lowest mean absolute percent error (MAPE) were selected as the best models for USA and India, respectively (MAPEUSA=1.04%, MAPEINDIA=0.41%). According to these models, it is predicted that the total number of cases in the USA will be 27.201 million and 10.788 million in India on February 04, 2021. This study shows that ARIMA models are suitable for predicting the prevalence of COVID-19 in the future. Analysis results can shed light on understanding the trends of the pandemic in these countries. © 2021 IEEE.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness Research and Surveillance,"The 2009 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic highlighted the need for improved scientific knowledge to support better pandemic preparedness and seasonal influenza control. The Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness Research and Surveillance (SHIVERS) project, a 5-year (2012–2016) multiagency and multidisciplinary collaboration, aimed to measure disease burden, epidemiology, aetiology, risk factors, immunology, effectiveness of vaccination and other prevention strategies for influenza and other respiratory infectious diseases of public health importance. Two active, prospective, population-based surveillance systems were established for monitoring influenza and other respiratory pathogens among those hospitalized patients with acute respiratory illness and those enrolled patients seeking consultations at sentinel general practices. In 2015, a sero-epidemiological study will use a sample of patients from the same practices. These data will provide a full picture of the disease burden and risk factors from asymptomatic infections to severe hospitalized disease and deaths and related economic burden. The results during the first 2 years (2012–2013) provided scientific evidence to (a) support a change to NZ's vaccination policy for young children due to high influenza hospitalizations in these children; (b) contribute to the revision of the World Health Organization's case definition for severe acute respiratory illness for global influenza surveillance; and (c) contribute in part to vaccine strain selection using vaccine effectiveness assessment in the prevention of influenza-related consultations and hospitalizations. In summary, SHIVERS provides valuable international platforms for supporting seasonal influenza control and pandemic preparedness, and responding to other emerging/endemic respiratory-related infections.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Prospective, Randomized, Open-Label, Blinded End Point, Two-Arm, Comparative Clinical Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of a Fixed Ayurvedic Regimen (FAR) as Add-on to Conventional Treatment in the Management of Mild and Moderate COVID-19 Patients","BACKGROUND: The traditional healthcare systems are being avidly looked into in the quest for effective remedies to tackle the menace of COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This was a prospective randomized, controlled open-label, blinded end point (PROBE) study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fixed ayurvedic regimen (FAR) as an add-on to conventional treatment/standard of care (SOC) in the management of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection. METHODOLOGY: A total of 68 patients were recruited who consumed either FAR + SOC (n = 35) or SOC only (n = 33) for 28 days. Primary outcomes assessed were mean time required for clinical recovery and proportion of patients showing clinical recovery between the groups. Secondary outcomes assessed included mean time required for testing SARS-CoV-2 negative, change in clinical status on World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale, number of days of hospitalization, change in disease progression and requirement of oxygen/intensive care unit admission/ventilator support/rescue medication, health status on WHO quality of life (QOL) BREF and safety on the basis of occurrence of adverse event/serious adverse event (AE/SAE) and changes in laboratory parameters. RESULTS: Patients consuming FAR as an add-on SOC showed faster clinical recovery from the day of onset of symptoms by 51.34% (P < 0.05) as compared to SOC group. A higher proportion of patients taking FAR recovered within the first 2 weeks compared to those taking only SOC. It was observed that 5 times more patients recovered within 7 days in FAR group when compared to SOC (P < 0.05) group. An earlier clinical recovery was observed in clinical symptoms such as sore throat, cough, loss of taste and myalgia (P < 0.05). Improvement in postclinical symptoms such as appetite, digestion, stress and anxiety was also obs served to be better with the use of FAR. Requirement of rescue medications such as antipyretics, analgesics and antibiotics was also found to be reduced in the FAR group (P < 0.05). FAR showed a significant improvement in all the assessed domains of QOL. None of the AEs/SAE reported in the study were assessed to be related to the study drugs. Further, FAR did not produce any significant change in the laboratory safety parameters and was assessed to be safe. CONCLUSION: FAR could be an effective and safe add-on ayurvedic regimen to standard of care in the management of mild and moderate COVID-19 patients.

Using Personal Genomic Data within Primary Care: A Bioinformatics Approach to Pharmacogenomics,"One application of personalized medicine is the tailoring of medication to the individual, so that the medication will have the highest chance of success. In order to individualize medication, one must have a complete inventory of all current pharmaceutical compounds (a detailed formulary) combined with pharmacogenetic datasets, the genetic makeup of the patient, their (medical) family history and other health-related data. For healthcare professionals to make the best use of this information, it must be visualized in a way that makes the most medically relevant data accessible for their decision-making. Similarly, to enable bioinformatics analysis of these data, it must be prepared and provided through an interface for controlled computational analysis. Due to the high degree of personal information gathered for such initiatives, privacy-sensitive implementation choices and ethical standards are paramount. The Personal Genetic Locker project provides an approach to enable the use of personal genomic data in primary care. In this paper, we provide a description of the Personal Genetic Locker project and show its utility through a use case based on open standards, which is illustrated by the 4MedBox system.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Evaluating A Nonemergency Medical Transportation Benefit For Accountable Care Organization Members.,"Nonemergency medical transportation benefits, often using smartphone application-based ridesharing services, are increasingly being offered as part of population health management programs. However, the impact of these programs on health care use and costs remains understudied. We conducted a mixed-methods evaluation of a nonemergency medical transportation benefit offered to members of a Medicare accountable care organization (ACO) within a large academic health system, the UNC Health Alliance ACO. Participation in the transportation program was associated with a greater number of per person per year outpatient visits (9.2) and higher outpatient spending ($4,420) than in a comparison group. However, there was no difference in inpatient admissions or emergency department visits, and the program was not cost saving. Qualitative analyses revealed that participants were highly satisfied with the program, reporting that it eased financial burdens and made them feel safer, more empowered, and better able to take control of their health. These findings suggest that although transportation programs are commonly introduced as ways to contain health care spending, it may be better to think of them as programs to improve health care access for people facing difficult circumstances.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Initiating Opioid Use Disorder Medication via Telemedicine During COVID-19: Implications for Proposed Reforms to the Ryan Haight Act,"BACKGROUND: The Ryan Haight Act generally requires a clinician to conduct an in-person visit before prescribing an opioid use disorder (OUD) medication. This requirement has impeded use of telemedicine to expand OUD treatment, and many policymakers have called for its removal. During the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning March 16, 2020, the requirement was temporarily waived. It is unclear whether clinicians who treat OUD patients perceive telemedicine to be a safe and effective means of OUD medication initiation. OBJECTIVE: To understand clinician use of and comfort level with using telemedicine to initiate patients on medication for opioid use disorder. DESIGN: National survey administered electronically via WebMD/Medscape’s online clinician panel in fall 2020. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 602 clinicians (primary care providers, psychiatrists, nurse practitioners or certified nurse specialists, and physician assistants) participated in the survey. MAIN MEASURES: Frequency of video, audio-only, and in-person visits for medication initiation, comfort level with using video for new patient visits with OUD. KEY RESULTS: Clinicians varied substantially in their use of telemedicine for medication initiation. Approximately 25% used telemedicine for most initiations while 40% used only in-person visits. The majority (55.8%) expressed at least some discomfort with using telemedicine for treating new OUD patients, although clinicians with more OUD patients were less likely to express such discomfort. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that a permanent relaxation of the Ryan Haight requirement may not result in widespread adoption of telemedicine for OUD medication initiation without additional supports or incentives.

"The Dynamics of Changes in the Concentration of IgG against the S1 Subunit in Polish Healthcare Workers in the Period from 1 to 12 Months after Injection, Including Four COVID-19 Vaccines","Background: The presented research made it possible to obtain the characteristics of changes in anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG within one year of vaccination in healthcare workers. Materials and Methods: The research group consisted of 18,610 participants represented by medical and administration staff. IgG antibody concentrations were determined by ELISA. Results: At 5–8 months after full vaccination, the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG with equal vaccines were similar. The exception was JNJ-78436735, for which IgG levels were significantly lower. In the 9th month after vaccination, an increase in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG level, suggesting asymptomatic infection, was observed in a large group of participants. Significantly higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were observed after the booster dose compared to the second dose. The increase in antibodies was observed already around the 5th day after the injection of the booster dose, and was maximized at approximately the 14th day. Conclusion: The cut-off date for protection against the disease seems to be the period 8–9 months from the vaccination for mRNA vaccines and 5–6 months for vector vaccines. The introduction of a booster dose was the right decision, which could have a real impact on restricting the further transmission of the virus.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
The Experience of Online Learning During COVID-19 Among Physiotherapy Undergraduates in a Lower Middle Income Country: A Report From Sri Lanka,"Introduction: /background: Online learning have existed for over a decade. However, lower middle income countries, such as Sri Lanka, have hardly utilized these services. Instead, they follow the traditional in-person teaching activities. Yet, with the onset of COVID-19, due to sheer necessity, an alternative method had to be utilized if university education was to proceed. Hence, this study’s main objective was to explore the experience of online learning among physiotherapy undergraduates during the pandemic. Method: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among physiotherapy undergraduates from all three universities in Sri Lanka that offer a physiotherapy degree. The study questionnaire, consisting of 49 items, was formulated based on a literature review. Each item assessed an aspect of online learning. Results: : Of the 147 responses obtained, 72% were females and 50% of the participants were from the 3 rd year of study. The results indicated that during the pandemic period, 63% of the participants spent between 10-40 hours on online learning. Students’ perception about online learning was assessed. Higher average values were obtained for all students’ perceptions statements regarding online learning. However, the perceived effectiveness of online learning, as compared to in-person learning, had a relatively low mean score. Being able to stay at home and to learn at their own pace were commonly mentioned advantages of online learning. However, 36% of participants indicated that internet connectivity issues impacted their learning whilst 78% of the participants indicated that clinical teaching and practical classes could not be replaced by online teaching. Hence, it appears that about 77% of the participants prefer a hybrid learning method, even post-pandemic, which is opined to be made more effective if the classes are more interactive, stimulating and engaging. Conclusion: The study results indicate that there are both positive and negative aspects of online learning education. Problems such as internet connectivity issues, possibly more prominent in lower income countries, should be addressed to provide a satisfactory learning experience to students. In looking to the future, post-pandemic, a hybrid teaching method would be ideal for a study programme that requires practical classes and clinical exposure.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Inference in Stochastic Epidemic Models via Multinomial Approximations,"We introduce a new method for inference in stochastic epidemic models which uses recursive multinomial approximations to integrate over unobserved variables and thus circumvent likelihood intractability. The method is applicable to a class of discrete-time, finite-population compartmental models with partial, randomly under-reported or missing count observations. In contrast to state-of-the-art alternatives such as Approximate Bayesian Computation techniques, no forward simulation of the model is required and there are no tuning parameters. Evaluating the approximate marginal likelihood of model parameters is achieved through a computationally simple filtering recursion. The accuracy of the approximation is demonstrated through analysis of real and simulated data using a model of the 1995 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We show how the method can be embedded within a Sequential Monte Carlo approach to estimating the time-varying reproduction number of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, recently published by Kucharski et al. 2020.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Determining depression and related factors in a society affected by COVID-19 pandemic,"BACKGROUND: Turkey has one of the highest death rates in the world due to COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic caused anxiety and depression in individuals. However, there is insufficient information on the effects of COVID-19 on individuals and their coping methods. Therefore, mental problems associated with the pandemic need to be evaluated rapidly. AIMS: This study was carried out to determine depression levels and related factors in a society affected by COVID-19. METHOD: The study was planned using a descriptive cross-sectional design. The study started 2 weeks after the first diagnosis of COVID-19 in Turkey and was carried out between March 23 and April 3, 2020. The study included 1115 adult participants who were between 18 and 65 years of age and were citizens of the Turkish Republic. The study was carried out using online questionnaires, and data were collected with the Personal Information Form and the Beck Depression Inventory. The data were evaluated using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 20 software program. RESULTS: The depression scores of female participants who were between 18 and 29 years of age, single, students, and had less income than their expenses were found to be higher than others. People who experienced fear of being infected and infecting others, had a cleaning obsession, anxiety about the future, sadness, and anxiousness experienced depression at lower levels when compared to other participants. Participants who had to change their place of residence during the quarantine, experienced loneliness, fear of death, hopelessness, sleep problems, felt useless and worthless, started to smoke and drink alcohol, and experienced depression at moderate levels. Depression scores of those who spent time with their family, made time for themselves, were busy with home education or work were lower compared to others. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic caused mild-level depression in the Turkish society.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Long Term Physical, Mental and Social Health Effects of COVID-19 in the Pediatric Population: A Scoping Review","BackgroundThe majority of COVID-19 symptom presentations in adults and children appear to run their course within a couple of weeks. However, a subgroup of adults has started to emerge with effects lasting several months or more after initial infection. However, little is known about long term physical, mental and social health effects of COVID-19 in the pediatric population. The purpose of this review was to determine these impacts well into the second year of the pandemic. MethodsA search was conducted using PUBMED, Web of Science, Science Direct, and COCHRANE between 11/1/2019 and 9/1/2021. Search inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) COVID-19 illness and symptoms in children; (2) SARS-COv2 in children; (3) English language; and (4) human studies only. ResultsThe few studies that have documented long-term physical symptoms in children show that fatigue, difficulty in concentrating (brain fog), sleep disturbances, and sensory problems are the most reported outcomes. Most studies examining the impact of COVID-19 in pediatric populations have focused on initial clinical presentation, and symptoms, which are similar to those in adult populations. Additionally, COVID-19 has had a moderate impact on children and adolescents social environment, which may exacerbate current and future physiological, psychological, behavioral, and academic outcomes. ConclusionsThere are limited studies reporting long physical symptoms of COVID-19 in the pediatric population. However, pediatric COVID-19 cases are underreported due to low rates of testing and symptomatic infection, which calls for more longitudinal studies. Children who have experienced COVID-19 illness should be monitored for long physiological, psychological, behavioral, and academic outcomes.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Expanding COVID-19 Vaccine Availability: Role for Combined Orthogonal Serology Testing (COST),"Background: The persisting Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and limited vaccine supply has led to a shift in global health priorities to expand vaccine coverage. Relying on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) molecular testing alone cannot reveal the infection proportion, which could play a critical role in vaccination prioritization. We evaluated the utility of a combination orthogonal serological testing (COST) algorithm alongside RT-PCR to quantify prevalence with the aim of identifying candidate patient clusters to receive single and/or delayed vaccination. Methods: We utilized 108,505 patients with suspected COVID-19 in a retrospective analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR vs. IgG-nucleocapsid (IgG(NC)) antibody testing coverage in routine practice for the estimation of prevalence. Prospectively, an independent cohort of 21,388 subjects was simultaneously tested by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and IgG(NC) to determine the prevalence. We used 614 prospective study subjects to assess the utility of COST (IgG(NC), IgM-spike (IgM(SP)), and IgG-spike (IgG(SP))) in establishing the infection proportion to identify a single-dose vaccination cohort. Results: Retrospectively, we observed a 6.3% (6871/108,505) positivity for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, and only 2.3% (2533/108,505) of cases had paired IgG(NC) serology performed. Prospectively, IgG(NC) serology identified twice the number of COVID-positive cases in relation to RT-PCR alone. COST further increased the number of detected positive cases: IgG(NC)+ or IgM(SP)+ (18.0%); IgG(NC)+ or IgG(SP)+ (23.5%); IgM(SP)+ or IgG(SP)+ (23.8%); and IgG(NC)+ or IgM(SP)+ or IgG(SP)+ (141/584 = 24.1%). Conclusion: COST may be an effective tool for the evaluation of infection proportion and thus could define a cohort for a single dose and/or delayed vaccination.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

The AEROsolization of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2): Phase I,"BACKGROUND: The degree to which Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is aerosolized has yet to be determined. The aim of this study is to prove methods of detection of aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized patients in anticipation of testing for aerosolization in procedural and operative settings. METHODS: In this prospective study, inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 were identified. Demographic information was obtained, and a symptom questionnaire was completed. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filters, which were attached to an air pump, were used to detect viral aerosolization and placed in four locations in each patient’s room. The filters were left in the rooms for a three-hour period. RESULTS: There were 10 patients who enrolled in the study, none of whom were vaccinated. Only two patients were more than a week from onset of symptoms, and half of the patients received treatment for COVID with antivirals and steroids. Among ten RT-PCR positive and hospitalized patients, and four filters per patient, there was only one positive SARS-CoV-2 aerosol sample, and it was directly attached to one of the patients. Overall, there was no correlation between symptoms or symptom onset and aerosolized test result. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this suggest that there is limited aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 and provided proof of concept for this filter sampling technique. Further studies with increased sample size should be performed in a procedural and operative setting to provide more information about SARS-CoV-2 aerosolization.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Analysis of COVID-19 using a modified SLIR model with nonlinear incidence,"Infectious diseases kill millions of people each year, and they are the major public health problem in the world. This paper presents a modified Susceptible-Latent-Infected-Removed (SLIR) compartmental model of disease transmission with nonlinear incidence. We have obtained a threshold value of basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] and shown that only a disease-free equilibrium exists when [Formula: see text] and endemic equilibrium when [Formula: see text]. With the help of the Lyapunov-LaSalle Invariance Principle, we have shown that disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium are both globally asymptotically stable. The study has also provided the model calibration to estimate parameters with month wise coronavirus (COVID-19) data, i.e. reported cases by worldometer from March 2020 to May 2021 and provides prediction until December 2021 in China. The Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) method was used to investigate how the model parameters’ variation impact the model outcomes. We observed that the most important parameter is transmission rate which had the most significant impact on COVID-19 cases. We also discuss the epidemiology of COVID-19 cases and several control policies and make recommendations for controlling this disease in China.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Recurrent TB: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the incidence rates and the proportions of relapses and reinfections.,"BACKGROUND A recurrent tuberculosis (TB) episode results from exogenous reinfection or relapse after cure. The use of genotyping allows the distinction between both. METHODS We did a systematic review and meta-analysis, using four databases to search for studies in English, French and Spanish published between 1 January 1980 and 30 September 2020 that assessed recurrences after TB treatment success and/or differentiated relapses from reinfections using genotyping. We calculated person years of follow-up and performed random-effects model meta-analysis for estimating pooled recurrent TB incidence rates and proportions of relapses and reinfections. We performed subgroup analyses by clinical-epidemiological factors and by methodological study characteristics. FINDINGS The pooled recurrent TB incidence rate was 2.26 per 100 person years at risk (95% CI 1.87 to 2.73; 145 studies). Heterogeneity was high (I2=98%). Stratified pooled recurrence rates increased from 1.47 (95% CI 0.87 to 2.46) to 4.10 (95% CI 2.67 to 6.28) per 100 person years for studies conducted in low versus high TB incidence settings. Background HIV prevalence, treatment drug regimen, sample size and duration of follow-up contributed too. The pooled proportion of relapses was 70% (95% CI 63% to 77%; I²=85%; 48 studies). Heterogeneity was determined by background TB incidence, as demonstrated by pooled proportions of 83% (95% CI 75% to 89%) versus 59% (95% CI 42% to 74%) relapse for studies from settings with low versus high TB incidence, respectively. INTERPRETATION The risk of recurrent TB is substantial and relapse is consistently the most frequent form of recurrence. Notwithstanding, with increasing background TB incidence the proportion of reinfections increases and the predominance of relapses among recurrences decreases.

Evaluating the emotion regulation of positive mood states among people with bipolar disorder using hierarchical clustering,"BACKGROUND: People with bipolar disorder (BD) frequently struggle with the recurrence of affective symptoms. However, the interplay between coping mechanism and positive mood state remains under-researched. AIM: To explore the associations among behavioral approach system (BAS) sensitivity level, coping, and positive mood states among people with BD. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, 90 participants with BD were presented with four BAS-activating life event scenarios and assessed with regard to their BAS trait sensitivity, coping flexibility, and mood states. A hierarchical clustering method was used to identify different groups with different styles of coping. Multiple hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to examine the mediating and moderating roles of different components of coping on mood states. RESULTS: A three-cluster solution was found to best fit the present data set. The findings showed that a low mass of coping combined with low BAS sensitivity level protects people with BD from detrimentally accentuating mood states when they encounter BAS-activating life events. Moreover, coping flexibility is demonstrated to mediate and moderate the relationships between BAS sensitivity level and mood states. Specifically, subduing the perceived controllability and reducing the use of behavioral-activation/emotion-amplifying coping strategies could help buffer the effect of positive affect. CONCLUSION: The judicious use of coping in emotion regulation for people with BD when encountering BAS-activating life events was indicated. Practical applications and theoretical implications are highlighted.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
COVID-19 patient care predicts nurses' parental burnout and child abuse: Mediating effects of compassion fatigue(),"BACKGROUND: Nurses who are also parents may be at risk not only for professional compassion fatigue, but also parental burnout – a reliable and valid predictor of child abuse and neglect. In support, recent research reveals that parents' COVID-19 related stressors predicted elevated potential for child abuse (Katz and Fallon, 2021). OBJECTIVE: We explored the harmful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses' parental burnout, child abuse, and child neglect, as mediated by compassion fatigue (i.e., a combination of job burnout and secondary traumatic stress). PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Participants were 244 nurses (M age = 32.4; 87% female) who were parents of young children (age 12 or under) recruited via chain referral sampling. METHODS: Participants completed an anonymous survey assessing the extent to which they care for COVID-19 patients, are exposed to patients suffering and dying from COVID-19, and have lost family income due to COVID-19. We also measured their compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, substance abuse, spouse conflict, parental burnout, child abuse, and child neglect. RESULTS: As hypothesized, direct care of COVID-19 patients, exposure to patient death and suffering due to COVID-19, and family income loss due to COVID-19 predicted greater compassion fatigue, which in turn, predicted greater parental burnout, child abuse, child neglect, spouse conflict, and substance abuse, (IEs ≥ 0.06, all ps < 0.05). Also, as compassion satisfaction increased, parental burnout, child abuse, child neglect, spouse conflict, and substance abuse decreased, rs ≥ −0.203, ps < 0.01. CONCLUSIONS: Theoretical implications and practical implications for medical practice and child abuse prevention are discussed.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"A description of rapid design and implementation of new features in an electronic health record in the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration response to the Covid-19 pandemic","The onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic called for the implementation of new functionality to the Electronic Health Record (EHR) system for the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and VA responded rapidly. VA’s EHR-related COVID-19 response can be grouped into two categories 1) a new banner to provide a rapid way to view a patient’s COVID-19 status and 2) EHR templates for addressing COVID-19 screening and patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 clinical reminder dialog templates were rapidly implemented to meet provider and patient needs for scenarios involving the care of patients suspected of COVID-19 infection and for treating and monitoring patients who tested positive. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with solution developers and users to elicit feedback on the design process as well as overall usability and utility. The new functionality in the EHR was developed, evaluated, and delivered at record speed in real time as the pandemic unfolded. This paper presents the process used for the rapid delivery of the new functionality and describes how VA was able to maintain a high standard of usability while creating this enhanced functionality in the face of an unprecedented challenge. https//doi.org/10.34105/j.kmel.2021.13.024",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
A comprehensive easy-to-use techno-human solution for the resource-constrained nations in the fight against communicable disease like the Coronavirus Pandemic,"Following the advent of the novel Coronavirus, the governments and authorities introduced various mobile applications in the fight against COVID-19. However, these are either restricted by the developer country or not comprised of certain key features, due to which, a vast population from the low- or middle-income country, remains underprivileged from associated benefits. The purpose of this study is to explore and demonstrate how to build a comprehensive and easy-to-use application for mobile health service delivery especially fabricated to fight communicable diseases like COVID-19. Mostly open-source technologies are used to build a distributed scalable client-server application. Then the application is evaluated with the stress-test and usability-test. Besides COVID-19 advisories and guidelines, the study demonstrates complete conceptualization and development of an IoT-based mobile application. It comprises three key features that bring comprehensiveness. One is the ‘contact logger & tracer’ that enables users to maintain a list of contacts who get notified if any of them reported COVID-19 positive in the last 14 days. Two is the ‘self-assessment' which helps users to predict the chances of COVID-19 infection using a scientific rationale. Three is the ‘infection tracker’ that guides users to identify infected hotspots to plan the route accordingly. The usability-test affirmed that the application is easy-to-use. Further, this study demonstrates how to construct such an easy-to-use application mostly with open-source resources. It can help the needy authorities or groups from resource-constrained countries to adopt and develop such applications quickly. Further research on the post-implementation effect will add value to this study.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Economic Policy Uncertainty Versus Sector Volatility: Evidence from India Using Multi-scale Wavelet Granger Causality Analysis,"The present study examines the relationship between Indian economic policy uncertainty (IEPU) and the different sector volatilities (SVs) of the Indian economy over the period 2006?2021. The relationship is studied using a multi-scale correlation framework, combining wavelet coherence analysis with the Granger causality test. The findings indicate a stronger relationship between the IEPU and SV for all sectors during COVID-19, primarily in the medium term. While IEPU led to SV during the global financial crisis (GFC), the SVs led to the IEPU during the COVID-19. However, the Granger causality test provides evidence that, in the long term, the SVs cause the IEPU while the IEPU leads to SV in the short term. The IT sector is crucial as its volatility leads to IEPU across all scales. These results have substantial implications for policymakers and portfolio managers.JEL Codes: G10, G17, G32",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Identifying SARS-CoV-2 antiviral compounds by screening for small molecule inhibitors of nsp15 endoribonuclease,"SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for COVID-19, a human disease that has caused over 2 million deaths, stretched health systems to near-breaking point and endangered economies of countries and families around the world. Antiviral treatments to combat COVID-19 are currently lacking. Remdesivir, the only antiviral drug approved for the treatment of COVID-19, can affect disease severity, but better treatments are needed. SARS-CoV-2 encodes 16 non-structural proteins (nsp) that possess different enzymatic activities with important roles in viral genome replication, transcription and host immune evasion. One key aspect of host immune evasion is performed by the uridine-directed endoribonuclease activity of nsp15. Here we describe the expression and purification of nsp15 recombinant protein. We have developed biochemical assays to follow its activity, and we have found evidence for allosteric behaviour. We screened a custom chemical library of over 5000 compounds to identify nsp15 endoribonuclease inhibitors, and we identified and validated NSC95397 as an inhibitor of nsp15 endoribonuclease in vitro. Although NSC95397 did not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 growth in VERO E6 cells, further studies will be required to determine the effect of nsp15 inhibition on host immune evasion.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
A two diffusion stochastic model for the spread of the new corona virus SARS-CoV-2,"We propose a refined version of the stochastic SEIR model for epidemic of the new corona virus SARS-Cov-2, causing the COVID-19 disease, taking into account the spread of the virus due to the regular infected individuals (transmission coefficient ß ), hospitalized individuals (transmission coefficient l ß , l > 0 ) and superspreaders (transmission coefficient ß ' ). The model is constructed from the corresponding ordinary differential model by introducing two independent environmental white noises in transmission coefficients for above mentioned classes - one noise for infected and hospitalized individuals and the other for superspreaders. Therefore, the model is defined as a system of stochastic differential equations driven by two independent standard Brownian motions. Existence and uniqueness of the global positive solution is proven, and conditions under which extinction and persistence in mean hold are given. The theoretical results are illustrated via numerical simulations.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Process and outcomes of telephone reassurance program training for older adult volunteers,"The purpose of this study was to examine the experience of Senior Companions with telephone reassurance program training delivered via Zoom and the feasibility of using teleconferencing as a platform for training older adult volunteers during the COVID-19 pandemic Volunteers were recruited from a local Senior Companion Program We assessed training enrollment and participation rates We also examined the overall participant experience with the program training by asking structured/semi-structured questions and analyzed the data using content analysis The average age of the volunteers was 72 5 (n=20) During the first recruitment, 39 Senior Companions expressed their interest in the program As a result, 20 out of 39 volunteers (51 3%) successfully completed the teleconference training (18 joined over the phone & 2 joined online) Findings from this pilot study suggest that the teleconferencing training was feasible for older adult volunteers and the volunteers discussed that the program training would benefit and support their volunteer roles The findings of this study provide insight for gerontological researchers and educators related to potential strategies for completing research and training in the midst of COVID-19 The use of teleconferencing training that incorporates best practices for older adults’ learning may offer promise for the potential scalability and sustainability of volunteer trainings during and after COVID-19",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Rapid Assessment and Containment of Candida auris Transmission in Postacute Care Settings-Orange County, California, 2019.","BACKGROUND Candida auris, a multidrug-resistant yeast, can spread rapidly in ventilator-capable skilled-nursing facilities (vSNFs) and long-term acute care hospitals (LTACHs). In 2018, a laboratory serving LTACHs in southern California began identifying species of Candida that were detected in urine specimens to enhance surveillance of C auris, and C auris was identified in February 2019 in a patient in an Orange County (OC), California, LTACH. Further investigation identified C auris at 3 associated facilities. OBJECTIVE To assess the prevalence of C auris and infection prevention and control (IPC) practices in LTACHs and vSNFs in OC. DESIGN Point prevalence surveys (PPSs), postdischarge testing for C auris detection, and assessments of IPC were done from March to October 2019. SETTING All LTACHs (n = 3) and vSNFs (n = 14) serving adult patients in OC. PARTICIPANTS Current or recent patients in LTACHs and vSNFs in OC. INTERVENTION In facilities where C auris was detected, PPSs were repeated every 2 weeks. Ongoing IPC support was provided. MEASUREMENTS Antifungal susceptibility testing and whole-genome sequencing to assess isolate relatedness. RESULTS Initial PPSs at 17 facilities identified 44 additional patients with C auris in 3 (100%) LTACHs and 6 (43%) vSNFs, with the first bloodstream infection reported in May 2019. By October 2019, a total of 182 patients with C auris were identified by serial PPSs and discharge testing. Of 81 isolates that were sequenced, all were clade III and highly related. Assessments of IPC identified gaps in hand hygiene, transmission-based precautions, and environmental cleaning. The outbreak was contained to 2 facilities by October 2019. LIMITATION Acute care hospitals were not assessed, and IPC improvements over time could not be rigorously evaluated. CONCLUSION Enhanced laboratory surveillance and prompt investigation with IPC support enabled swift identification and containment of C auris.

A Qualitative Study of Health Workers' Experiences During Early Surges in the COVID-19 Pandemic in the U.S.: Implications for Ongoing Occupational Health Challenges,"BACKGROUND: Health workers (HWs) have faced significant threats to physical and psychological health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The recent surges associated with the spread of the delta variant in the U.S., coupled with political resistance to effective public health mitigation strategies, indicate that the risks experienced early in the pandemic are not likely to abate soon. This study sought to better understand the experiences, thoughts, concerns, and recommendations of HWs during one of the first major surges in the U.S. and to explore how these experiences might inform efforts to mitigate potential ongoing COVID-related negative health and psychological impacts on HWs. METHODS: HWs were recruited using a multi-faceted approach tailored to public health mitigation guidelines. Semi-structured interviews were conducted via video conference with front line HWs, support staff, and opioid use disorder service organization providers between April 1 and July 9, 2020 using the Social-Ecological Model as a framework. Interviews were audio-recorded and professionally transcribed; transcripts were analyzed inductively and deductively using thematic analytic methods, generating major themes and subthemes. RESULTS: A total of 22 HWs participated in the study; 14 were female; 3 identified as a member of a racial or ethnic minority population. Major themes identified included: (1) Institutions, Infrastructure, and the Pandemic; (2) Working Under Fire; (3) The Political Becomes Personal and (4) Hope. Themes and subthemes explicated the ways in which phenomena at personal, interpersonal, community, organizational, and societal levels affected HWs experiences and suggested potential mechanisms through which negative effects on HW mental health and health may be mitigated. CONCLUSIONS: Previous global infectious disease epidemics have had profound negative effects on HWs' health and mental health. This study suggests the potential for similar negative impacts that may be exacerbated by the U.S.'s current sociopolitical milieu. Efforts to systematically describe and quantify these effects and to intervene to mitigate them are warranted.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Analysis of Immune Escape Variants from Antibody-based Therapeutics against Covid-19,"Accelerated SARS-CoV-2 evolution under selective pressure by massive deployment of neutralizing antibody-based therapeutics is a concern with potentially severe implications for public health. We review here reports of documented immune escape after treatment with monoclonal antibodies and COVID19 convalescent plasma (CCP). While the former is mainly associated with specific single amino acid mutations at residues within the receptor-binding domain (e.g., E484K/Q, Q493R, and S494P), the few cases of immune evasion after CCP were associated with recurrent deletions within the N-terminal domain of Spike protein (e.g, {Delta}HV69-70, {Delta}LGVY141-144 and {Delta}AL243-244). Continuous genomic monitoring of non-responders is needed to better understand immune escape frequencies and fitness of emerging variants.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Discrimination in Lending? Evidence from the Paycheck Protection Program,"We assess the role of race in loans made through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The PPP program, created by the US government as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, provides loans to small businesses so they can keep employees on their payroll. We argue that the historical record and the PPP program design choices made it likely that many Black-owned businesses received smaller PPP loans than they should have. We find that Black-owned businesses received loans that were approximately 50% lower than observationally similar white-owned businesses. The effect is marginally smaller in areas with more bank competition and disappeared over time as changes to the PPP program were implemented.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Allosteric binders of ACE2 are promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had enormous health, economic, and social consequences. Vaccines have been successful in reducing rates of infection and hospitalization, but there is still a need for an acute treatment for the disease. We investigate whether compounds that bind the human ACE2 protein can interrupt SARS-CoV-2 replication without damaging ACE2’s natural enzymatic function. Initial compounds were screened for binding to ACE2 but little interruption of ACE2 enzymatic activity. This set of compounds was extended by application of quantitative structure-activity analysis, which resulted in 512 virtual hits for further confirmatory screening. A subsequent SARS-CoV-2 replication assay revealed that five of these compounds inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells. Further effort is required to completely determine the antiviral mechanism of these compounds, but they serve as a strong starting point for both development of acute treatments for COVID-19 and research into the mechanism of infection.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Dancing for Parkinson’s: A Gateway for Connectedness to Peers and Social Assurance,"The first-year student experience in college is a crucial time for personal and professional development, especially for students entering science, technology, education, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Unfortunately, it is also the time when students most commonly leave STEM, largely due to disconnection from faculty and peers. The Freshman Research Initiative (FRI) is a program that introduces first-year undergraduates to research in a variety of fields. The program has shown positive outcomes for student success and retention in STEM fields. However, it has not been demonstrated whether this program can increase social connectedness and assurance, potentially contributing to students’ longer-term retention in STEM. In this pilot study, we measured social connectedness/assurance among students before and after a 16-week course in neurophysiology. We found that combined scores of social connectedness and assurance significantly increased by the end of the course. We also found that individual constructs of social connectedness and assurance significantly increased. Furthermore, the majority of students from FRI were retained in STEM fields. We plan future studies to include collection of longitudinal data and measures to identify additional reasons that the FRI increased these positive outcomes among our student participants.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Investigating the Relationship Between Informal Economy and Competitiveness in Iran’s Metropolises,"This article aims to analyze informal economy and competitiveness after the 1979 Revolution in Iran with an emphasis on its eight metropolitan cities. The research method is descriptive-analytical, and data is collected from official resources and statistics. The analysis for data related to economic competitiveness was carried out using technique for order of reference by similarity to ideal solution, entropy, and numerical taxonomy. The results of this study suggest that state modernism has been effective in the growth of urbanization and the decline of urbanization, which has changed Iranians’ life patterns from rural to urban in the wake of the 1979 Revolution. There is also a direct relationship between rural–urban migration and informal economic growth in the process of urbanization and urbanization in Iran. The informal economy sector, which accounts for 31% of Iran’s economy, ranks 30th in the world. The survey of informal economy in Iranian metropolises shows that 35% of its metropolises’ GDP comes from the informal economy. The results illustrate the imbalanced employment situation in these metropolises. The highest rate of female and male employees was recorded in Mashhad (81.16 and 90.55) and the lowest in Ahvaz (64.38 and 77.00), respectively. The majority of industrial workers lived in Qom (35.61), and the lowest number of industrial workers was in Mashhad (14.09). Also, the highest number of service workers was in Shiraz (78.40) and the lowest in Qom (54.34). Most of the agricultural labor force lived in Ahwaz (2.74) with Tehran hosting the lowest number of agricultural workers (0.98).",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Modeling compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines: the critical role of trust in science.,"The coronavirus pandemic is one of the biggest health crises of our time. In response to this global problem, various institutions around the world had soon issued evidence-based prevention guidelines. However, these guidelines, which were designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 and contribute to public well-being, are (deliberately) disregarded by some individuals. In the present study, we aimed to develop and test a multivariate model that could help us identify individual characteristics that make a person more/less likely to comply with COVID-19 prevention guidelines. A total of 525 attentive participants completed the online survey. The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) show that COVID-19 risk perception and trust in science both independently predict compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines, while the remaining variables in the model (political conservatism, religious orthodoxy, conspiracy ideation and intellectual curiosity) do so via the mediating role of trust in science. The described model exhibited an acceptable fit (χ2(1611) = 2485.84, p < .001, CFI = .91, RMSEA = .032, SRMR = .055). These findings thus provide empirical support for the proposed multivariate model and underline the importance of trust in science in explaining the different levels of compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Mindfulness in Pediatrics: Practices to Improve Clinician and Patient Mental Health and Enhance Well-Being,"Children and adolescents with symptoms of mental health disorders often present to primary care settings. In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, mental health symptoms in children, adolescents, families, and health care clinicians are rising. Mindfulness is an approach to improve both mental and physical health that can be practiced freely in any circumstance.

Assessing COVID-19’s “known unknowns”: potential impacts on marine plastic pollution and fishing in the South China Sea,"This paper examines three of the COVID-19 pandemic’s “known” impacts to date: its widespread and fundamental altering of government policy priorities; record low oil prices and its role in further escalating already heightened levels of strategic competition in East Asia and weakening of the existing multilateral order. The paper then uses some of the observed outcomes of these changes under the pandemic so far, in addition to additional evidence and causal linkages drawn from past research, to assess COVID-19’s potential, but still unknown, longer term influence on marine plastic pollution and overfishing in the South China Sea, two of East Asia’s most pressing marine environmental problems. In addition to flagging potential COVID-19 linked issues of concern in these two important policy areas, this approach also may assist further inquiry into the pandemic’s still unknown potential to undermine environmental protection and regulatory efforts in other environmental issue areas.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Crystal structure of the Rubella virus protease reveals a unique papain-like protease fold,"Rubella is well-controlled due to an effective vaccine, but outbreaks are still occurring without any available antiviral treatments. There is still much to learn about the rubella virus (RUBV) papain-like protease (RubPro) that could be a potential drug target. This protease is crucial to RUBV replication, cleaving the non-structural polyprotein p200 into 2 multi-functional proteins, p150 and p90. Here we report a novel crystal structure of RubPro at 1.64 Å resolution. It has a similar catalytic core structure to that of SARS-CoV-2 and foot-mouth-disease virus (FMDV) proteases. RubPro has well-conserved sequence motifs that are also found in its newly discovered Rubivirus relatives. The RubPro construct was shown to have protease activity in trans against a construct of RUBV protease-helicase and fluorogenic peptide. A protease-helicase construct was also cleaved in E. coli expression. RubPro was demonstrated to possess deubiquitylation activity, suggesting a potential role of RubPro in modulating the host’s innate immune responses. The structural and functional insights of the RubPro will advance our current understanding of its function and point to more structure-based research into the RUBV replication machinery, in hopes of developing antiviral therapeutics in the future.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Epidemiology and postoperative complications of hip fracture during COVID-19 pandemic,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to analyze the changes in epidemiology and the postoperative outcomes in patients with hip fractures during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to non-pandemic period. METHODS: According to the date of declaration of “mandatory social distance”, we separated patients into 2 groups over a 1-year period: Period A and period B. We assessed the overall time to surgery, delay in surgery (> 24 hours, > 36 hours, and > 48 hours), reason of delay, length of hospital stay, type of surgery, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: The number of operated hip fractures and other trauma decreased in period B compared with period A by 17%, and 23%, respectively. The number of patients with delay in surgery by > 24 hours and > 36 hours was significantly higher in period B compared to that in period A (P = 0.035, P = 0.012, respectively). However, no significant difference in the number of delay in surgery > 48 hours and mean overall time to surgery between the 2 groups was observed (P = 0.856, P = 0.399, respectively). There was no difference in the duration of hospital stay, type of surgery, and postoperative complications between periods A and B. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the decrease in hip fractures was relatively fewer compared to the decrease in orthopedic trauma. Although hip fracture surgeries were delayed for over 24 hours and 36 hours, there was no increase in delay for over 48 hours and postoperative complications.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Corticosteroid treatment in critically ill patients with severe influenza pneumonia: a propensity score matching study,"PURPOSE: To determine clinical predictors associated with corticosteroid administration and its association with ICU mortality in critically ill patients with severe influenza pneumonia. METHODS: Secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of critically ill patients with confirmed influenza pneumonia admitted to 148 ICUs in Spain between June 2009 and April 2014. Patients who received corticosteroid treatment for causes other than viral pneumonia (e.g., refractory septic shock and asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] exacerbation) were excluded. Patients with corticosteroid therapy were compared with those without corticosteroid therapy. We use a propensity score (PS) matching analysis to reduce confounding factors. The primary outcome was ICU mortality. Cox proportional hazards and competing risks analysis was performed to assess the impact of corticosteroids on ICU mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1846 patients with primary influenza pneumonia were enrolled. Corticosteroids were administered in 604 (32.7%) patients, with methylprednisolone the most frequently used corticosteroid (578/604 [95.7%]). The median daily dose was equivalent to 80 mg of methylprednisolone (IQR 60–120) for a median duration of 7 days (IQR 5–10). Asthma, COPD, hematological disease, and the need for mechanical ventilation were independently associated with corticosteroid use. Crude ICU mortality was higher in patients who received corticosteroids (27.5%) than in patients who did not receive corticosteroids (18.8%, p < 0.001). After PS matching, corticosteroid use was associated with ICU mortality in the Cox (HR = 1.32 [95% CI 1.08–1.60], p < 0.006) and competing risks analysis (SHR = 1.37 [95% CI 1.12–1.68], p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Administration of corticosteroids in patients with severe influenza pneumonia is associated with increased ICU mortality, and these agents should not be used as co-adjuvant therapy.

Being present: Examining the efficacy of an Internet Mantram Program on RN-delivered patient-centered care,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted nurses’ compassionate presence during stressful conditions. Strategies to reduce workplace stress are needed. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a stress reduction strategy, an Internet-based Mantram Repetition Program (MRP), for nurses caring for hospitalized Veterans. METHODS: A one group pre-/post-test design was used to assess change in nurses’ perceived outcomes after participating in the MRP. A post-test-only design was used to assess hospitalized Veterans’ perceptions of nursing presence and satisfaction with care. Qualitative interviews were used to supplement quantitative data. FINDINGS: Patients perceived high levels of presence and satisfaction with care. Post MRP, nurses perceived increased mindfulness, compassion satisfaction, spiritual well-being, and nursing presence. Increased mindfulness was associated with greater compassion satisfaction and less burnout. DISCUSSION: For nurses working on the front lines of patient care, the potential for experiencing stress and burnout is a reality. Participating in a MRP could lessen these effects and facilitate nursing presence.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Antibody-Mediated Neutralization of Authentic SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 Variants Harboring L452R and T478K/E484Q,"The capacity of convalescent and vaccine-elicited sera and monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants is currently of high relevance to assess the protection against infections. We performed a cell culture-based neutralization assay focusing on authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.427/B.1.429 (Epsilon), all harboring the spike substitution L452R. We found that authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring L452R had reduced susceptibility to convalescent and vaccine-elicited sera and mAbs. Compared to B.1, Kappa and Delta showed a reduced neutralization by convalescent sera by a factor of 8.00 and 5.33, respectively, which constitutes a 2-fold greater reduction when compared to Epsilon. BNT2b2 and mRNA1273 vaccine-elicited sera were less effective against Kappa, Delta, and Epsilon compared to B.1. No difference was observed between Kappa and Delta towards vaccine-elicited sera, whereas convalescent sera were 1.51-fold less effective against Delta, respectively. Both B.1.617 variants Kappa (+E484Q) and Delta (+T478K) were less susceptible to either casirivimab or imdevimab. In conclusion, in contrast to the parallel circulating Kappa variant, the neutralization efficiency of convalescent and vaccine-elicited sera against Delta was moderately reduced. Delta was resistant to imdevimab, which, however, might be circumvented by combination therapy with casirivimab together.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Patient characteristics, treatment strategy, outcomes, and hospital costs of acute coronary syndrome: 3 years of data from a large high-volume centre in Central Europe","Managing patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in an ageing population with comorbidities is clinically and economically challenging. Well-conducted unselected registries are essential for providing information on real-day clinical practice. The aim was to create a long term, very detail-controlled registry of unselected patients admitted with ACS to a high-volume centre in Central Europe. Consecutive patients admitted with confirmed ACS were entered into the prospective registry from 1 October 2018 to 30 September 2021. Data on 214 parameters, including clinical characteristics, angiographic findings, laboratory and therapeutic findings, financial costs, and in-hospital mortality, were obtained for all patients. Analyses were performed on the complete dataset of 1804 patients. Of these patients, 694 (38.5%) were admitted for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and 1110 (61.5%) were admitted for non-ST-elevation (NSTE)-ACS [779 with NSTE myocardial infarction (NSTE-MI) and 331 with unstable angina (UA)]. Almost all patients (99%) underwent coronary angiography. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed in 93.4% of STEMI patients and 74.5% of NSTE-ACS patients. Patients with NSTE-MI had the longest total hospital stay (8.1 ± 9.1 days) and highest financial costs (8579.5 ± 7173.2 euros). In-hospital mortality was 1.2% in UA, 6.2% in NSTE-MI, and 10.9% in STEMI patients. Age older than 75 years, pre-hospital cardiac arrest and/or mechanical ventilation, subacute STEMI, and ejection fraction below 40% were the most powerful predictors of in-hospital mortality as assessed by multivariate analyses. The in-hospital mortality of unselected NSTE-MI and STEMI patients in daily practice is not low despite very good implementation of guideline-recommended therapy with a high rate of revascularization. The highest financial costs are associated with NSTE-MI.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Prevalence and predictors of self-reported sexual abuse in severely obese patients in a population-based bariatric program.,"BACKGROUND Sexual abuse may be associated with poorer weight loss outcomes following bariatric treatment. Identifying predictors of abuse would enable focused screening and may increase weight management success. METHODS We analyzed data from 500 consecutively recruited obese subjects from a population-based, regional bariatric program. The prevalence of self-reported sexual abuse was ascertained using a single interview question. Health status was measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify sexual abuse predictors. RESULTS The mean age was 43.7 y (SD 9.6), 441 (88.2%) were females, 458 (91.8%) were white, and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 47.9 kg/m(2) (SD 8.1). The self-reported prevalence of past abuse was 21.8% (95% CI 18.4-25.4%). Abused subjects had worse health status (VAS score 53.1 (SD 21.2) versus 58.0 (SD 20.1), P = 0.03). BMI was not associated with abuse (P > 0.5). Age, sex, BMI, and covariate-adjusted independent predictors of abuse included alcohol addiction (adjusted odds ratio 15.8; 95% CI 4.0-62.8), posttraumatic stress disorder (4.9; 2.5-9.5), borderline personality (3.8; 1.0-13.8), depression (2.4; 1.3-4.3), and lower household income (3.4; 1.6-7.0). CONCLUSIONS Abuse was common amongst obese patients managed in a population-based bariatric program; alcohol addiction, psychiatric comorbidities, and low-income status were highly associated with sexual abuse.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Forecasting undetected COVID-19 cases in Small Island Developing States using Bayesian approach,"In dealing with the COVID-19, the fundamental question is how many actually undetected cases are going around regarding the capabilities of current health systems to contain the virus?. Due to a large number of asymptomatic cases, most COVID-19 cases are possibly undetected. For that reason, this study aims to provide an e[ff]icient, versatile, easy to compute, and robust estimator for the number of undetected cases using Bayes theorem based on the actual COVID-19 cases. This theorem is applied to 25 Small Island Developing States (SIDS) due to SIDS vulnerability. The results in this study forecast that possibly undetected COVID-19 cases are approximately 4 times larger than the numbers of actual COVID-19 cases as observed. This finding highlights the importance of using modeling tool to get the better and comprehensive of current COVID-19 cases and to take immediately precaution approaches to mitigate the growing numbers of COVID-19 cases as well.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
En mann i 90-årene med feber og tørrhoste./ En mann i 90-årene med feber og tørrhoste./ A man in his nineties with fever and dry cough,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 can cause a fatal outcome in elderly patients, as this case report illustrates. CASE PRESENTATION: An active male in his nineties with a high level of function, despite several severe chronic diseases, was admitted to Oslo University Hospital after two days of fatigue, fever, dyspnoea and dry cough. He scored qSOFA 1 of 3 points due to high respiratory rate, and SIRS 2 of 4 points due to high respiratory rate and fever of 39.4º C. PCR for influenza virus was negative and he received benzylpenicillin for pneumonia. The chest X-ray taken initially showed no lung affection. On day 5 after symptom debut he was tested for COVID-19 which was positive. He had not been travelling to high-risk areas or been exposed to any known confirmed COVID-19 patients. On the same day, a chest CT scan was performed that showed ground-glass opacities. In subsequent days the patient's health rapidly deteriorated. He developed irreversible respiratory failure with hypoxia without hypercapnia despite substantial oxygen support. Chest X-ray taken on disease day 7 showed progression of consolidations. The patient died 9 days after symptom debut. INTERPRETATION: This case illustrates a severe course of COVID-19 with fatal outcome. The patient was also one of the earliest admitted with COVID-19 in a Norwegian hospital and marked a new phase of the epidemic, as he had not been travelling to high-risk areas or been exposed to any confirmed COVID-19 patients.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
A Public Health Summer Experience for High School Students,"Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, many high school students were unaware of careers in public health?that there are many options available for those interested in improving health and preventing disease beyond being a doctor or a nurse The Rutgers School of Public Health (R-SPH) developed PHocus (Public Health: Outbreaks, Communities, and Urban Studies) to introduce high school students to the interdisciplinary field of public health as well as to promote population and individual health The PHocus Summer Experience was designed for high school students to explore population health and learn about the fundamentals of epidemiology, the breadth of topics addressed by public health, and public health careers R-SPH hosted PHocus as 1-week sessions in Summer 2018 and 2019, available at both the School?s Piscataway, New Jersey, and Newark, New Jersey, locations The Newark sessions targeted recruitment from high schools with underserved, minority, and/or economically disadvantaged students, and tuition for these students was supported through external funding Across 2018 and 2019 PHocus Summer Experiences, 130 students participated, representing 63 high schools, in four 1-week sessions The experience was rated very highly by participants;on a 4-point scale (1 = strongly disagree to 4 = strongly agree), the median score for the program being a worthwhile experience was 4 0 R-SPH faculty, staff, and students, as well as external stakeholders, eagerly volunteered to be part of the program, suggesting that this educational program can be reproduced at other schools and programs of public health",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Student and educator perspectives on virtual institutional introductory pharmacy practice experience (IPPE),"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has required governments around the world to suspend face-to-face learning for school and university students. Colleges of pharmacy are faced with the challenge of training students in hospitals that are under considerable pressure at this time. The government of Saudi Arabia has moved all classes and training online to limit the spread of the virus. This study describes the experience of the Introductory and Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (IPPE and APPE) students and preceptors engaged in the virtual IPPE training. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to describe and appraise the implemented virtual IPPE training from the experiences of IPPE and APPE students, and their preceptor. The IPPE students described their experiences in close-ended questionnaires, while APPE students in open-ended questionnaires, and the preceptor described the experiences in narrative. The study focused on highlighting the advantages, opportunities, challenges, and shortcomings of the virtual training. RESULTS: Two preceptors and seven APPE students participated in the preparation and administration of the virtual training. The IPPE students’ experiences, based on 87 respondents, were mostly positive. Although IPPE students enjoyed the time flexibility that allowed the learning of new skills and reflection on previous experiences, 15% experienced difficulty finding quiet places with a reliable internet connection or had difficulty working on team-based activities. Moreover, some were anxious about the lack of adequate patient-care experience. On the other hand, the APPE students found the experience enriching as they gained experience and understanding of academic workflow, gained skills, and overcame the challenges they faced during this virtual training experience. CONCLUSIONS: Future training programs should be organized to overcome the challenges and to maximize the benefits of training experiences. Schools of pharmacy may benefit from the training materials constructed, prepared, and administered by APPE students to improve IPPE students’ learning experiences and outcomes.

Ensaio Clínico De Diferentes Doses De Remifentanila Em Gatas Anestesiadas Com Isofluorano E Submetidas À Ovariohisterectomia,"Machado, Marcela Lemos. Ensaio clínico de diferentes doses de remifentanila em gatas anestesiadas com isofluorano e submetidas a ovariohisterectomia. Dissertação (Mestrado em Ciências Cardiovasculares) Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal Fluminense. Introdução: A redução das doses dos fármacos obtidas com técnicas anestésicas balanceadas tem como propósito diminuir a incidência de efeitos adversos, com o objetivo final de melhorar os resultados e a segurança dos procedimentos anestésicos. Na prática veterinária, a anestesia balanceada é normalmente realizada com a combinação de anestésicos inalatórios e opioides sistémicos. Por outro lado, a adição de analgésicos opioides aos anestésicos gerais pode proporcionar bloqueio autonómico eficaz. Consequentemente, estudos clínicos que investigam a associação de opioides à anestésicos inalatórios são justificados para melhor definir seu papel clínico na anestesia felina. Objetivo: o objetivo deste estudo foi identificar uma dose que proporcionasse condições anestésicas e cirúrgicas ótimas, bem como comparar a resposta cardiovascular à estimulação cirúrgica, analgesia pós-operatória, duração e qualidade de recuperação anestésica entre as taxas de infusão de remifentanila testadas. Método: 27 gatas foram randomizadas para receber remifentanila 0,1 g.kg.min-1 (REMI01), 0,2 g.kg.min-1 (REMI02) ou 0,4 g.kg.min-1 (REMI04). Após a pré-medicação anestésica com acepromazina, indução com propofol, os gatos foram ventilados mecanicamente e a anestesia foi mantida em aproximadamente 1,0 concentração alveolar mínima (CAM) de isofluorano (1,63% de isofluorano final da expiração (EtISO)). A taxa de infusão de remifentanila foi aumentada ou diminuída em 20% se a pressão arterial aumentasse ou diminuísse em 20% aos valores anteriores. A frequência cardíaca (FC), pressão arterial sistólica (PAS), temperatura esofágica, oximetria de pulso (SpO2), concentração de CO2 final (EtCO2) e EtISO foram registradas em diferentes pontos de tempo durante a cirurgia. Meloxicam foi administrado antes do final da cirurgia. Os dados dentro de cada grupo de tratamento foram analisados utilizando uma análise de variância de modelo misto (ANOVA) e o teste de Friedman seguido por Wilcoxon. Foram utilizados testes post-hoc de Bonferroni ou Dunnet. Kruskal-Wallis seguido pelo teste de Dunn pós-hoc foram usados para comparar dados entre os grupos, significância foi estabelecida em (p <0,05). Resultados: o tempo de decúbito esternal e o tempo de posição quadrupedal foram significativamente maiores no REMI04 do que nos outros grupos. A PAS foi maior quando comparada com os valores basais nos grupos REMI01 e REMI02 do que no REMI04. Não foi observada diferença significativa no FC entre os grupos. Um gato em REMI01 e outro em REMI02 necessitaram de analgesia de resgate pós-operatória. Conclusão: a dose de 0,4 g.kg.min-1 é a mais apropriada para ser utilizado em gatas submetidas à ovariohisterectomia e anestesiadas com 1,0 CAM de isofluorano.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Water Circular Economy at the Kwinana Industrial Area, Western Australia—the Dimensions and Value of Industrial Symbiosis","The major industrial companies located in the Kwinana Industrial Area (KIA) produce many industrial, agricultural and mining chemicals and refined materials, for national and international markets. With over 150 documented product and by-product exchanges, Kwinana is considered to be one of the best examples of industrial symbiosis (IS) in the world. A new model of IS comprised of four dimensions is under development, whereby whilst each dimension is unique, collectively, they interact to characterise an industrial estate, thus contributing to the evolutionary understanding of IS. We investigate the basis for this model through an analysis of two water circular economy examples as they relate to Western Australia’s premier industrial area, the KIA. Case studies will consider a managed aquifer recharge (MAR) project that failed and the process water interconnectedness of enterprises operating successfully as a sub-ecology within the industrial cluster. Apart from the traditional product and by-product dimension of IS, three additional dimensions seem to be playing a crucial role in the KIA, these being the skilled workforce, support industry and governance dimensions. We provide additional context for the water-related examples of the circular economy at Kwinana by exploring a new four-dimensional model for IS.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Machine Translation, Sentiment Analysis, Text Similarity, Topic Modelling, and Tweets: Understanding Social Media Usage Among Police and Gendarmerie Organizations","It is well known that social media has revolutionized communication. Nowadays, citizens, companies, and public institutions actively use social media in order to express themselves better to the population they address. This active use is also carried out by the gendarmerie and police organizations to communicate with the public with the purpose of improving social relations. However, it has been seen that the posts by the gendarmerie and police organizations did not attract much attention from their target audience from time to time, and it has been discovered that there was not enough research in the literature on this issue. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the use of social media by the gendarmerie and police organizations operating in Turkey (Jandarma - Polis), Italy (Carabinieri - Polizia), France (Gendarmerie - Police) and Spain (Guardia Civil - Polic\'ia), and the extent to which they can be effective on the followers, by comparatively examining their activity on twitter. According to the obtained results, it was found that Jandarma (Turkey) has the highest power of influence in the twitter sample, and the findings were comparatively presented in the study.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Why does COVID-19 disproportionately affect older people?,"The severity and outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) largely depends on a patient's age. Adults over 65 years of age represent 80% of hospitalizations and have a 23-fold greater risk of death than those under 65. In the clinic, COVID-19 patients most commonly present with fever, cough and dyspnea, and from there the disease can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, lung consolidation, cytokine release syndrome, endotheliitis, coagulopathy, multiple organ failure and death. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity increase the chances of fatal disease, but they alone do not explain why age is an independent risk factor. Here, we present the molecular differences between young, middle-aged and older people that may explain why COVID-19 is a mild illness in some but life-threatening in others. We also discuss several biological age clocks that could be used in conjunction with genetic tests to identify both the mechanisms of the disease and individuals most at risk. Finally, based on these mechanisms, we discuss treatments that could increase the survival of older people, not simply by inhibiting the virus, but by restoring patients' ability to clear the infection and effectively regulate immune responses.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Association of County-Level Racial Diversity and Likelihood of a Textbook Outcome Following Pancreas Surgery,"INTRODUCTION: Residential racial desegregation has demonstrated improved economic and education outcomes. The degree of racial community segregation relative to surgical outcomes has not been examined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing pancreatic resection between 2013 and 2017 were identified from Medicare Standard Analytic Files. A diversity index for each county was calculated from the American Community Survey. Multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression with a random effect for hospital was used to measure the association of the diversity index level with textbook outcome (TO). RESULTS: Among the 24,298 Medicare beneficiaries who underwent a pancreatic resection, most patients were male (n = 12,784, 52.6%), White (n = 21,616, 89%), and had a median age of 72 (68–77) years. The overall incidence of TO following pancreatic surgery was 43.3%. On multivariable analysis, patients who resided in low-diversity areas had 16% lower odds of experiencing a TO following pancreatic resection compared with patients from high-diversity communities (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72–0.98). Compared with patients who resided in the high-diversity areas, individuals who lived in low-diversity areas had higher odds of 90-day readmission (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.03–1.31) and had higher odds of dying within 90 days (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.45–2.38) (both p < 0.05). Nonminority patients who resided in low-diversity areas also had a 14% decreased likelihood to achieve a TO after pancreatic resection compared with nonminority patients in high-diversity areas (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.73–1.00). CONCLUSION: Patients residing in the lowest racial/ethnic integrated counties were considerably less likely to have an optimal TO following pancreatic resection compared with patients who resided in the highest racially integrated counties.

Pancreas transplantation perceptions and practice: Results from a national U.S. survey.,"Due to a substantial decline in pancreas transplantation (PT) across the United States over the past 15 years, we sought to understand the perceptions and practices of US PT programs. Surveys were sent to members of the American Society of Transplantation Surgeons and the American Society of Transplantation by email and professional society postings between August 2019 to November 2019. One hundred twenty three responses were recorded from 56 unique programs. Program characteristics were obtained from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. Respondents were transplant surgeons (71%), transplant nephrologists (17%), trainees (9%), and allied professionals (3%). Programs were defined according to annual volume as: low (<5 PT/year), intermediate (6-20), or high (>20). High-volume programs reported that these factors were most important for increased PT: expansion of recipient selection, more aggressive donor utilization, and hiring of PT program-specific personnel. At both the program and national level, the vast majority (82% and 79%, respectively) felt the number of PTs currently performed are not in balance with patients' needs. Overall, programs reported that the option of PT is not offered adequately to diabetic patients and that strategies to maintain higher PT volume are most evident at intermediate, and especially, high-volume programs.

"Remittances, financial development and poverty reduction in Sub-Saharan Africa: Implications for post-COVID-19 macroeconomic policies","To design and implement effective post-COVID-19 macroeconomics policies to tackle poverty in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), policymakers need to understand the factors shaping poverty in the region. This paper investigates the effect of international remittances and financial development on poverty alleviation in 44 sub-Saharan African SSA countries from 2010 to 2019. The instrumental variable generalised method of moment technique results indicated that while remittances increase poverty, financial development contributes significantly to poverty reduction. The results consistently revealed that remittances increase both male and female poverty rates, while financial development significantly reduces male and female poverty rates. Other factors such as economic growth, foreign direct investment, and trade openness contributed significantly to reducing poverty. In contrast, government expenditure and foreign aid were found to increase poverty rate in SSA. These results are robust to the Lewbel two-stage least squares estimator. The practical implications of these findings for post-COVID-19 macroeconomic policies in SSA are discussed. © 2021 The Society for Policy Modeling",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
[Eye traumatism during the COVID-19 sanitary crisis at Iota-teaching hospital]./ Traumatismes oculaires pendant la crise sanitaire de COVID-19 au CHU de Iota,"INTRODUCTION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have witnessed a world-wide lock-down of the population. This government action combined with the application of social distancing should in principle reduce the frequency of occurrence of ocular injuries. The goal of our work is to try to understand the circumstances of the occurrence of ocular injuries at the IOTA Teaching Hospital during the lock-down period of the COVID-19 health crisis. METHODOLOGY: This was a cross-sectional, descriptive study. The data were collected prospectively. Our study covered the period from March to May 2020. All consenting patients seen at the IOTA Teaching Hospital for ocular trauma regardless of gender, age, circumstances in which the trauma occurred or the nature of the injuries were included by non-probability sampling. Excluded from the study were patients who did not consent or who consulted for a non-traumatic ophthalmologic condition. RESULTS: There were a total of 138 cases, of which 84 were male and 54 female, for a gender ratio of M/F=1.5. Children aged 0 to 5 years represented more than 3/4 (79.14%) of our sample. Trauma occurred in 45.83% of cases during leisure activities and 3.60% of cases involved domestic violence. DISCUSSION: According to the authors, measures aimed at limiting public movement, particularly the curfews introduced by the Malian government to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, may actually result in trauma. CONCLUSION: Raising public awareness of the social and psychological consequences of lock-down through audiovisual means might significantly reduce the frequency of these ocular traumas.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Social risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 acquisition in University students: cross sectional survey,"ObjectivesTo define risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in University of Cambridge students during a period of increased incidence in October and November 2020. Study designSurvey MethodsRoutine public health surveillance identified a marked increase in the numbers of University of Cambridge students with respiratory illness and SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the 10 days after a national lockdown was announced in the UK on 5 November 2020. Cases were identified both through symptom-triggered testing and a universal asymptomatic testing program. An online questionnaire was sent to all University of Cambridge students on 25 November to investigate risk factors for testing positive in the period after 30th October 2020. This asked about symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 test results, in-person teaching settings, other aspects of University life, and attendance at social events in the period just prior to lockdown, from 30th October and 4th November 2020. Univariate and multivariable analyses were undertaken evaluating potential risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 positivity. ResultsAmong 3,980 students responding to the questionnaire, 99 (2.5%) reported testing SARS-CoV-2 positive in the period studied; 28 (28%) were asymptomatic. We found strong independent associations with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were attendance at two social settings in the City of Cambridge (adjusted odds ratio favouring disease 13.0 (95% CI 6.2,26.9) and 14.2 (95% CI 2.9,70)), with weaker evidence of association with three further social settings. By contrast, we did not observe strong independent associations between disease risk and type of accommodation or attendance at, or participation in, a range of activities associated with the University curriculum. ConclusionsAttendance at social settings can facilitate widespread SARS-CoV-2 transmission in University students. Constraint of transmission in higher education settings needs to emphasise risks outside University premises, as well as a COVID-safe environment within University premises. HighlightsO_LIIn a population of University students, a large increase in individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 occurred in the days following a national lockdown. C_LIO_LIAttendance at particular social gatherings was strongly linked to the development of disease, independent of other risk factors. C_LIO_LIBy contrast, a range of risk factors including age, gender, ethnicity, accommodation type, shared kitchen facilities, attendance at supermarkets, and attending teaching sessions were not significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 risk.

Right-siting of medical care: role of the internist.,"General internal medicine is now an essential service, and may in time be the main vehicle of delivery of healthcare to an ageing population, since resources are finite. One model for an equitable system of healthcare delivery may be the integration of General Internal Medicine as the core matrix, around which the various subspecialties deliver quality care. This is now a reality in many hospitals, where all subspecialists serve for varying periods in general medical wards, some even achieving dual accreditation. This promotes integration rather than fragmentation of services. Subspecialties will thrive, for the general workload will also be shared by internists in an equitable fashion. The obvious beneficiaries are the patients, and the health economics will also benefit the funding bodies. The services provided by internists must also be expanded into new fields, e.g. medicine for disasters, so as to promote cost-effective medical care, research and teaching, and also to achieve right-siting of patient care. It must also be emphasised that the specialties remain integral parts of the matrix, so that all departments complement one another, rather than compete with each other. The collegiality engendered is essential for a more congenial workplace, so as to promote staff retention.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Telemonitoring for the Follow-Up of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Patients Treated with CPAP: Accuracy and Impact on Therapy,"Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) telemonitoring (TMg) has become widely implemented in routine clinical care. Objective measures of CPAP compliance, residual respiratory events, and leaks can be easily monitored, but limitations exist. This review aims to assess the role of TMg in CPAP-treated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. We report recent data related to the accuracy of parameters measured by CPAP and try to determine the role of TMg in CPAP treatment follow-up, from the perspective of both healthcare professionals and patients. Measurement and accuracy of CPAP-recorded data, clinical management of these data, and impacts of TMg on therapy are reviewed in light of the current literature. Moreover, the crucial questions of who and how to monitor are discussed. TMg is a useful tool to support, fine-tune, adapt, and control both CPAP efficacy and compliance in newly-diagnosed OSA patients. However, clinicians should be aware of the limits of the accuracy of CPAP devices to measure residual respiratory events and leaks and issues such as privacy and cost-effectiveness are still a matter of concern. The best methods to focus our efforts on the patients who need TMg support should be properly defined in future long-term studies.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
High Prevalence of Deep Venous Thrombosis in Non-Severe COVID-19 Patients Hospitalized for a Neurovascular Disease,"Introduction: Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection induces COVID-19 along with venous thromboembolic occurrences particularly in intensive care units. For non-severe COVID-19 patients affected by neurovascular diseases, the prevalence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is unknown. The aim of our study was to report data obtained after systematic Doppler ultrasound scanning (DUS) of lower limbs in such patients. Methods: Between March 20 and May 2, 2020, the deep venous system of 13 consecutive patients diagnosed with neurovascular diseases and non-severe COVID-19 was investigated with a systematic bedside DUS. Results: Thirteen patients were enrolled in the study including 9 acute ischaemic strokes, 1 occlusion of the ophthalmic artery, 1 transient ischaemic attack, 1 cerebral venous thrombosis and 1 haemorrhagic stroke. On admission, the median National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was of 6 (IQR, 0–20). During the first week after admission, and despite thromboprophylaxis, we found a prevalence of 38.5% of asymptomatic calves’ DVT (n = 5). One patient developed a symptomatic pulmonary embolism and 2 other patients died during hospitalization. The outcome was positive for the other patients with a discharge median NIHSS score of 1 (IQR, 0–11). Discussion/Conclusion: Despite thromboprophylaxis, systematic bedside DUS showed a high prevalence (38.5%) of asymptomatic DVT in non-severe COVID-19 patients suffering from a neurovascular disease. In the absence of a reliable marker of DVT, we suggest that this non-invasive investigation could be an interesting tool to monitor peripheral venous thrombotic complications in such patients.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Local environment modulates whole-transcriptome expression in the seagrass Posidonia oceanica under warming and nutrients excess.,"The intensification of anomalous events of seawater warming and the co-occurrence with local anthropogenic stressors are threatening coastal marine habitats, including seagrasses, which form extensive underwater meadows. Eutrophication highly affects coastal environments, potentially summing up to the widespread effects of global climate changes. In the present study, we investigated for the first time in seagrasses, the transcriptional response of different plant organs (i.e., leaf and shoot apical meristem, SAM) of the Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica growing in environments with a different history of nutrient enrichment. To this end, a mesocosm experiment exposing plants to single (nutrient enrichment or temperature increase) and multiple stressors (nutrient enrichment plus temperature increase), was performed. Results revealed a differential transcriptome regulation of plants under single and multiple stressors, showing an organ-specific sensitivity depending on plants' origin. While leaf tissues were more responsive to nutrient stress, SAM revealed a higher sensitivity to temperature treatments, especially in plants already impacted in their native environment. The exposure to stress conditions induced the modulation of different biological processes. Plants living in an oligotrophic environment were more responsive to nutrients compared to plants from a eutrophic environment. Evidences that epigenetic mechanisms were involved in the regulation of transcriptional reprogramming were also observed in both plants' organs. These results represent a further step in the comprehension of seagrass response to abiotic stressors pointing out the importance of local pressures in a global warming scenario.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"SARS-CoV-2: Impact on, Risk Assessment and Countermeasures in German Eye Banks","INTRODUCTION: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic there has been some debate regarding the risk of transmission through tissue transplantation and tissue banking processes AIM OF THE STUDY: To analyze the changes that SARS-CoV-2 has caused regarding the harvesting of corneal donor tissue and eye bank activities in Germany METHODS: A questionnaire was provided to 26 eye banks in Germany, consisting of questions about adaptations made in the screening of potential donors and the harvesting of corneal tissue following the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 RESULTS: Eighteen eye banks actively reduced recruitment of donors and two banks ceased all activity Additional diagnostic screening was performed in eight banks, using conjunctival swabs and/or nasopharyngeal swabs In six eye banks, additional protective measures, such as FFP2 masks and/or facial shields, were implemented Overall, a mean reduction in the number of obtained donor tissues of 17% was observed DISCUSSION: Conjunctival and/or nasopharyngeal swabs of donors have been implemented by a minority Reasons for not performing additional tests may be moderate sensitivity and lack of validation for postmortem use of RT-PCR testing Also, the hazard of SARS-CoV-2 entering the corneal donor pool with subsequent transmission might be perceived as theoretical Face shields provide a sufficient barrier against splash and splatter contamination but may be insufficient against aerosols Additional face masks would provide support against aerosols, but it remains debatable if corneal harvesting can be considered an aerosol-producing procedure In the future we expect to see changes in current guidelines because of a surge in scientific activities to improve our understanding of the risks involved with cornea donation in the COVID-19 pandemic, and because current practice may reduce the availability of donor corneas due to new exclusion criteria while the demand remains unchanged",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Fear vs. Hope in India: Finding the Silver Lining amid the Dark Clouds of COVID-19,"COVID-19 has been declared a global pandemic, and the associated high rates of morbidity and mortality have made individuals susceptible to mental health problems that affect their psychological well-being. Although individual strengths can shield the negative impact of adverse conditions, their protective role in the context of COVID-19 has not received much attention. This study examines the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and mental health via rumination through the lens of hope as a personal psychological strength. This study employed a two-wave longitudinal design. Data was collected from 412 Indian participants with a time interval of three months and analyzed using a two-step approach to structural equation modelling. Fear of COVID-19 was found to a have negative effect on mental health through rumination. However, results from moderation analysis support the role of hope as a buffer against the indirect negative impact of fear of COVID-19 on mental health outcomes. As one of the first studies to demonstrate the role of psychological strengths of individuals in coping with the direct and indirect psychological ramifications of COVID-19 over a period of time, it contains important implications for the development of mental health interventions in the face of this global crisis.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Robust Automated Framework for COVID-19 Disease Identification from a Multicenter Dataset of Chest CT Scans,"The objective of this study is to develop a robust deep learning-based framework to distinguish COVID-19, Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP), and Normal cases based on chest CT scans acquired in different imaging centers using various protocols, and radiation doses. We showed that while our proposed model is trained on a relatively small dataset acquired from only one imaging center using a specific scanning protocol, the model performs well on heterogeneous test sets obtained by multiple scanners using different technical parameters. We also showed that the model can be updated via an unsupervised approach to cope with the data shift between the train and test sets and enhance the robustness of the model upon receiving a new external dataset from a different center. We adopted an ensemble architecture to aggregate the predictions from multiple versions of the model. For initial training and development purposes, an in-house dataset of 171 COVID-19, 60 CAP, and 76 Normal cases was used, which contained volumetric CT scans acquired from one imaging center using a constant standard radiation dose scanning protocol. To evaluate the model, we collected four different test sets retrospectively to investigate the effects of the shifts in the data characteristics on the model's performance. Among the test cases, there were CT scans with similar characteristics as the train set as well as noisy low-dose and ultra-low dose CT scans. In addition, some test CT scans were obtained from patients with a history of cardiovascular diseases or surgeries. The entire test dataset used in this study contained 51 COVID-19, 28 CAP, and 51 Normal cases. Experimental results indicate that our proposed framework performs well on all test sets achieving total accuracy of 96.15% (95%CI: [91.25-98.74]), COVID-19 sensitivity of 96.08% (95%CI: [86.54-99.5]), CAP sensitivity of 92.86% (95%CI: [76.50-99.19]).",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Laryngeal Evaluation during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Transcervical Laryngeal Ultrasonography,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has quickly become a global pandemic since its initial outbreak in China in late 2019. Institutions are faced with the challenge of upholding the standard of care while maintaining safety for health care personnel and patients. Due to the common performance of aerosol-generating endoscopic procedures in the upper respiratory tract, otolaryngologists are at uniquely high risk for potential infection. When possible, alternative diagnostic and treatment strategies should be pursued. For patients suspected of having functional laryngeal abnormalities, transcervical laryngeal ultrasound provides a rapid and noninvasive evaluation of vocal fold motion to inform decisions about safety of feeding, airway, and progression of care.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Mediators of invasions in the sea: life history strategies and dispersal vectors facilitating global sea anemone introductions,"Widespread non-native species tend to demonstrate an apparent lack of selectivity in habitat requirements, feeding regimes, and reproductive needs, while displaying a tendency to thrive in human-modified habitats. The high phenotypic plasticity typical of sessile, substrate-attached marine species may enhance their chances of survival and spread in a new region. Anthropogenic activities have changed marine habitats over a wide range of phenomena, including water temperature, community species composition, and the types of available substrates, creating new physical and biotic regimes that may contribute to the potential for successful species introduction. Here we examine ten species of sea anemones that have been introduced outside of their native range, and elucidate specific characteristics that are common among globally introduced sea anemones. Various life history strategies enable these species to survive and flourish through transport, introduction, establishment and spread, leading to the successful colonization of a new geographic area. Considering life history strategies and weighing of vector potential, we suggest conditions that facilitate introduction of these species, and identify species of sea anemones that may be introduced in the future in the face of changing climate and increased anthropogenic activities.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Characterization of human vascular endothelial cadherin glycans,"The glycosylation pattern of human vascular endothelial cad-herin (VE-cadherin), purified from cultured human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells, was analyzed. VE-cadherin was metabolically radiolabeled with D-[6-(3)H]glucosamine, isolated by immunoprecipitation, purified by SDS-PAGE and in-gel digested with endoproteinase Asp N. Oligosaccharides were sequentially released from resulting glycopeptides and analyzed by chromatographic profiling. The results revealed that VE-cadherin carries predominantly sialylated diantennary and hybrid-type glycans in addition to some triantennary and high mannose-type species. Highly branched, tetra-antennary oligosaccharides were found in trace amounts only. Immunohistochemical labeling of VE-cadherin and sialic acids displayed a codistribution along the intercellular junctions in endothelial cells of human umbilical arteries, veins, and cultured endothelial monolayers. Ca(2+)-depletion, performed on cultured endothelial cells, resulted in a reversible complete disappearance of VE-cadherin and of almost all sialic acid staining from the junctions. Sialidase treatment of whole cells caused a change of VE-cadherin immunofluorescence from a continuous and netlike superstructural organization to a scattered inconsistent one. Hence, cell surface sialic acids might play a role in VE-cadherin organization.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
EP.TH.335 Through the Lens of a Pandemic: The Impact of COVID-19 on Breast Cancer,"AIMS: On March 11(th) 2020 the UN accorded COVID-19 pandemic status. On March 15(th), the Association of Breast Surgery released guidelines in light of the pandemic. Eight days later the UK government announced the first lockdown. GP referrals fell in April/May. The aim of this study is to review how COVID-19 affected breast cancer management. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with breast cancer attending their initial appointment between March 16(th) to September 18(th) (pandemic phase) and 1(st) January to 15(th) March(pre-pandemic). Primary outcomes were pandemic-related modification of treatment plans, and diagnosis of COVID-19 or related complications. Secondary outcomes were delay in presentation or advanced disease. B-Map-C and the CovidSurg Collaborative were used as Gold Standards. RESULTS: 39 patients were in the pandemic phase and 45 in the pre-pandemic. 3/39(7.69%) and 14/45(31%) had surgery delayed. There were no COVID diagnoses. In-situ cancers were held on a deferred list until local guidelines changed. 2 patients had interim endocrine therapy. 9/39 underwent chemotherapy, of which 4 were neoadjuvant. 2/39 patients presented late to their GP, of which one had widespread metastases. 9/39(23.08%) were lymph node positive. In the pre-pandemic group, 6/45(13.3%) were lymph node positive, 2/45(4.4%) had distant metastases. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that breast surgery can be safely carried out during this pandemic and treatment postponement should be avoided as the pandemic continues. It remains to be seen if delayed treatments during 2020 will impact on local relapse and overall survival rates.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Changes in Maternal Substance Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Objective: Maternal stress and mental health challenges have increased since the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic began. Experts are concerned about elevated substance use (SU) given its well-known association with negative emotions, but existing research has not examined SU among mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a critical next step to inform policy and service supports given links between maternal SU and adverse family experiences. Methods: Data were collected online between April 14-28, 2020. Five-hundred and eight mothers (Mage=34.8 years, SD=5.1) with children 0-8 years old participated via the Parenting During the Pandemic study. Mothers self-reported SU change and motivations for using substances, as well as mental health symptoms. Results: Of participating mothers, 54.9% did not change, 39.2% increased, and 5.9% decreased their SU. Findings indicated mothers with an anxiety disorder or elevated anxiety symptoms were more likely to report increased SU during the pandemic. Using substances to cope with anxiety, depression, and boredom, was elevated among mothers self-reporting increased SU during the pandemic versus those reporting no change or a decrease in usage. Using substances to cope with anxiety was a risk factor for increased SU. Conclusions: Many mothers have increased their SU since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results highlight the need to treat maternal anxiety and the importance of teaching mothers coping strategies, other than using substances, to reduce the incidence of increased SU among mothers and its negative sequelae.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Vascularized Organoids: A More Complete Model,"As an emerging research model in vitro, organoids have achieved major progress in recapitulating morphological aspects of organs and personalized precision therapy. Various organoids have been currently constructed in vitro (e.g., brain, heart, liver, and gastrointestinal). Though there are prominent advantages on microstructures and partial functions, most of them have been encountering a frustrating challenge that stromal components (e.g., blood vessels) are in short supplement, which has imposed the main dilemma on the application of such model ex vivo. As advanced technologies, co-culturing pluripotent stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, with endothelial cells on 3D substrate matrix, are leaping forward, a novel model of an organoid with vascularization is formed. The mentioned contribute to the construction of the functional organoids derived from corresponding tissues, making them more reliable in stem cell research and clinical medicine. The present study overall summarizes progress of the evolution, applications and prospects of vascularized organoids.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

The impact of COVID-19 on the labour market for persons affected by Hansen's disease,"The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the whole world, affecting the econ-omy of many societies, increasing poverty and inequalities. The lockdown measures heavily affected vulnerable social groups, including persons affected by Hansen’s disease (PaHd) and their families. Stigma, late diagnosis and related disability make PaHd a population in a situation of vulnerability. Poor sanitary and socio-economic conditions, lower levels of education and food insecurity are risk markers for Hansen’s disease. Before COVID-19, PaHd were refused employment or lost their jobs due to physical impairment or discrimination. Job losses worldwide are hitting hardest on poor and vulnerable populations, therefore pushing millions of people to extreme poverty. Hansen’s disease, also known as leprosy, is only endemic in the poorest areas of the world. Although specific data regarding PaHd are scarce, we traced a parallel between the impact of the current pandemic on the labour market on various excluded and marginalized populations, such as persons with disabilities and PaHd. Our objective was to understand the current scenario and also to gather strategies and good practices to guarantee and promote the right to work as an instrument of inclusion and social advancement, to break the cycle of poverty for PaHd. © The author(s).",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Bayesian modeling to unmask and predict influenza A/H1N1pdm dynamics in London.,"The tracking and projection of emerging epidemics is hindered by the disconnect between apparent epidemic dynamics, discernible from noisy and incomplete surveillance data, and the underlying, imperfectly observed, system. Behavior changes compound this, altering both true dynamics and reporting patterns, particularly for diseases with nonspecific symptoms, such as influenza. We disentangle these effects to unravel the hidden dynamics of the 2009 influenza A/H1N1pdm pandemic in London, where surveillance suggests an unusual dominant peak in the summer. We embed an age-structured model into a bayesian synthesis of multiple evidence sources to reveal substantial changes in contact patterns and health-seeking behavior throughout the epidemic, uncovering two similar infection waves, despite large differences in the reported levels of disease. We show how this approach, which allows for real-time learning about model parameters as the epidemic progresses, is also able to provide a sequence of nested projections that are capable of accurately reflecting the epidemic evolution.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Implicit as compared with explicit safety procedures: the experiences of Israeli nurses.,"Approaches to nurses' safety in health care organizations, including modifying individual behavior through enforced compliance with safety rules and mandatory participation in safety training, have been of only modest benefit in reducing injuries. Apparently, what matters is not the existence of guidelines, but their implementation. The aim of the present study was to explore nurses' implicit safety theories concerning when to comply with safety rules. Using a multimethod approach, including semistructured interviews (perceptions), observations (real-time behavior), and documentary evidence from 15 nursing units (90 nurses), we found that nurses developed implicit rules for when and how to protect themselves. These included: (a) continue providing care for the patient even at the price of protecting yourself, (b) do not disturb other nurses' work, (c) it cannot happen to me!, (d) be aware of recently occurring accidents, and (e) protect yourself when significant others are present. These implicit rules seemed to be reinforced by personal, social, and contextual factors at the unit, limiting the likelihood that the decision makers (nurses) would discover their fallacy.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Serological evaluation of patients with coronavirus disease-2019 in Daegu, South Korea","BACKGROUND: Early and accurate detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical to prevent spread of the infection. Understanding of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is insufficient, particularly in relation to those whose responses persist for more than 1 month after the onset of symptoms. We conducted a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test to identify factors affecting the serological response and to evaluate its diagnostic utility in patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND FINDING: We collected 1,048 residual serum samples from 396 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. The samples had been used for routine admission tests in six healthcare institutions in Daegu. Antibody to SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed and the cutoff index (COI) was calculated for quantitative analysis. The patients’ information was reviewed to evaluate the relationship between antibody positivity and clinical characteristics. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rate was 85% and the average COI was 24·3. The positivity rate and COI increased with time elapsed since symptom onset. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody persisted for at least 13 weeks after symptom onset at a high COI. There was a significant difference in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rate between patients with and without symptoms, but not according to sex or disease course. The descending COI pattern at weeks 1 to 5 after symptom onset was significantly more frequent in patients who died than in those who recovered. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody persisted for at least 13 weeks at a high COI in patients with COVID-19. A decreasing COI pattern up to fifth week may be associated with a poor prognosis of COVID-19. As new treatments and vaccines are introduced, it is important to monitor continuously the usefulness of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
The androgen receptor regulates a druggable translational regulon in advanced prostate cancer.,"The androgen receptor (AR) is a driver of cellular differentiation and prostate cancer development. An extensive body of work has linked these normal and aberrant cellular processes to mRNA transcription; however, the extent to which AR regulates posttranscriptional gene regulation remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that AR uses the translation machinery to shape the cellular proteome. We show that AR is a negative regulator of protein synthesis and identify an unexpected relationship between AR and the process of translation initiation in vivo. This is mediated through direct transcriptional control of the translation inhibitor 4EBP1. We demonstrate that lowering AR abundance increases the assembly of the eIF4F translation initiation complex, which drives enhanced tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, we uncover a network of pro-proliferation mRNAs characterized by a guanine-rich cis-regulatory element that is particularly sensitive to eIF4F hyperactivity. Using both genetic and pharmacologic methods, we demonstrate that dissociation of the eIF4F complex reverses the proliferation program, resulting in decreased tumor growth and improved survival in preclinical models. Our findings reveal a druggable nexus that functionally links the processes of mRNA transcription and translation initiation in an emerging class of lethal AR-deficient prostate cancer.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Phytotherapeutic approaches and ethnopharmacological responses against covid-19,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the most important public health problem in 2020, poses severe health and socioeconomic impact. Many people turn to herbal therapy to prevent infection with the virus or alleviate the symptoms caused by it. This study evaluates the patterns of phytotherapy-based product utilization in the prevention against SARS-COV-2 and their reported effectiveness. This cross-sectional survey used a convenience sample of 287 adults who had used any form of phytotherapeutics to help fight and/or treat COVID-19 infection. The majority (n = 194, 67.6%) of participants had used plants from the Rutaceae family (like lemon and oranges), followed by those of Amaryllidaceous (namely, Garlic and Onion). Participants said that physicians and pharmacists were the primary sources of information about phytotherapy (n=107, 37.3%), and their decision was driven by their positive attitude towards herbal medicine or plant-based products (n=133, 46.3%). Many participants did not notice any side effects of these remedies (n=270, 94%) and believed they were effective (n = 184, 64%). This study provides an overview of the many phytotherapeutic remedies used in the era of COVID-19 by Jordanian society, which could prompt the conduction of interventional trials to assess the effectiveness and safety of this modality of therapy, either as a stand-alone or adjuvant treatment. © 2021 the authors.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
The Sixth Mass Extinction,"After the five mass extinctions on Earth that were caused by meteorite impacts, volcanism and large-scale climate change, several scientists predict that we are currently at the beginning of a sixth mass extinction. In this scenario, it is humankind that is causing the mass extinction with the illegal trade in wildlife as one of the most important hazards to wildlife species. This chapter presents an analysis of the causes and consequences of the global defaunation in the context of technological innovation and industrialisation of the wildlife trade. The complexity of the current decline of biodiversity and the effect of defaunation will be demonstrated by the sensibility of ecological interaction between animals and plants. The exploitation of natural resources has become a part of the social, political and economic dynamics.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Reflections on how country leaders have tackled COVID-19: How androgynous leadership succeeded in this crisis,"Purpose: This paper aims to review the latest management developments across the globe and pinpoint practical implications from cutting-edge research and case studies.

"CovHos, a New Score to Predict the Need of Hospitalization for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Patients at the Emergency Department","Introduction and aim: As first receivers of suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, clinicians of the Emergency Department (ED) have to rapidly perform the first clinical assessment evaluating the intensity of care needed. So far, clear management guidelines still lack. We identified variables associated with hospitalization in order to give a quick tool to assist clinicians in stratifying cases based on the severity at their arrival at the ED and in predicting the need for hospital care. Methods: This is a monocentric observational prospective study enrolling COVID-19 patients. A score for hospitalization prediction (CovHos Score) was created using variables associated with hospitalization at multivariate analysis and then validated on an internal subsequent cohort. Results: A total of 667 patients were included; 465 (69.7%) were hospitalized and 108 (16.2%) died at 30-days follow-up. In a multivariate analysis, male sex, age>65, alveolar-to-arterial oxygen gradient percentage increase compared to that expected for age, neutrophils/lymphocytes ratio and C-reactive protein levels were significantly associated with a higher rate of hospital admission. A CovHos score cut-off of 12 points predicted hospitalization with 85% sensitivity and 82.4 % specificity (area under a receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] = 0.909, 95% CI 0.884 - 0.935). Similar results were obtained in the validation court. A cut-off of 22 has 79% sensitivity and 77% specificity in predicting mortality (AUROC = 0.824; 95% CI 0.782-0.866); sensitivity and specificity were respectively 71.4% and 71.3% in the validation group. Conclusions: Although medical judgment still remains crucial, the CovHos score is an effective tool to assist emergency clinicians in predicting the need for hospitalization or to optimize allocation in a shortage of hospital resources.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Emergency Medical Services resource capacity and competency amid COVID-19 in the United States: Preliminary findings from a national survey,"Abstract OBJECTIVE This study aimed to investigate available resources, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) availability, sanitation practices, institutional policies, and opinions among EMS professionals in the United States amid the COVID-19 pandemic using a self-report survey questionnaire. METHODS An online 42-question multiple choice survey was randomly distributed between April 1, 2020, and April 16, 2020 to various active Emergency Medical Services (EMS) paid personnel in all 50 U.S. states including the District of Columbia (n=192). We approximate a 95% confidence interval (± 0.07). RESULTS An overwhelming number of EMS providers report having limited access to N95 respirators, receiving little or no benefits from COVID-19 related work, and report no institutional policy on social distancing practices despite CDC recommendations. For providers who do have access to N95 respirators, 31% report having to use the same mask for 1 week or longer. Approximately ⅓ of the surveyed participants were unsure of when a COVID-19 patient is infectious. The data suggests regular decontamination of EMS equipment after each patient contact is not a regular practice. DISCUSSION Current practices to educate EMS providers on appropriate response to the novel coronavirus may not be sufficient, and future patients may benefit from a nationally established COVID-19 EMS response protocol. Further investigation on whether current EMS practices are contributing to the spread of infection is warranted. The data reveals concerning deficits in COVID-19 related education and administrative protocols which pose as a serious public health concern that should be urgently addressed.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
How might COVID-19 affect the Indigenous labour market?,"Macroeconomic shocks and the policy responses to those shocks have significant effects on Australia's economy However, research into impacts of such shocks on the Indigenous labour force is limited This paper explores how the COVID-19 crisis is likely to affect Indigenous labour market outcomes in future While this paper briefly examines the immediate consequences of the COVID-19 crisis for Indigenous economic outcomes, it discusses the likely longer-run consequences for Indigenous employment at some length The sectoral concentration of Indigenous employment, the relatively high levels of casual employment and the relatively young age profile of the Indigenous population may increase Indigenous exposure to significant economic risks Indigenous business disproportionately employ Indigenous workers, but such businesses are concentrated in small to medium enterprises that may be sensitive to recessionary conditions, especially if economic uncertainty leads to a more generalised financial crisis involving liquidity constraints Recent history demonstrates that Indigenous employment rates have increased only gradually in the long period of macroeconomic growth leading up to the pandemic Historical disadvantage, discrimination and geographical constraints are important drivers of the dynamics of Indigenous labour market disadvantage, that limit educational attainment and ability to find work For those Indigenous people who secure employment, it can be difficult to retain employment COVID-19 is likely to lead to an intense period of structural adjustment in the economy, and it is important for the Indigenous community and businesses to position themselves to take advantage of potential opportunities and minimise potential risks The ongoing digital divide may be a particular problem for Indigenous people accessing work remotely Poor access to the internet of a substantial number of Indigenous households may also exacerbate access to remote education Such issues have important implications for addressing Indigenous disadvantage in future",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Professional Career of Women in OMS,"The COVID-19 pandemic altered all facets of society on a fundamental level, impacting work, mental health, and family life. Female surgeons experienced gender inequity and bias prior to COVID, therefore, women in OMS were affected disproportionately by the repercussions of the pandemic. Well-established inequalities are intensified during times of crisis. The potential success of a female academic surgeon, during the pandemic, is influenced by: lack of adequate and proper fitting personal protective equipment (PPE); shifting to virtual only educational formats; decreasing research publications; and bearing the burden of domestic responsibilities.

Personality and early susceptibility to COVID‐19 in the United Kingdom,"This paper takes advantage of a unique dataset with a prospectively longitudinal, nationally representative sample (n = 5,178) that began in 1958 and has information on COVID‐19 health status in 2020 to examine the effect of Big Five personality traits on compliance with social distancing requirements and contraction of COVID‐19. The results show some consistency with epidemiological recommendations (Conscientious individuals were more likely to maintain social distance and less likely to contract COVID‐19; men were less likely to comply and more likely to contract) but more inconsistency (Agreeable individuals were more likely to comply with social distancing requirements yet more likely to contract COVID‐19; Open and Neurotic individuals were no less likely to comply yet more likely to contract COVID‐19). The results highlight the importance of Big Five personality factors for behaviour in the global pandemic and may call into question the universal effectiveness of social distancing requirements for all individuals. However, the small number of confirmed cases of COVID‐19 during the early months of the pandemic requires caution in interpretation of the results.

Performance of Two Different Pulse Oximeters in Neonatal Transition.,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the performance of two different pulse oximeter technologies by comparing the time taken to achieve reliable oxygen saturation readings during neonatal transition. METHODS This cross-sectional study was done to compare the performance of two pulse oximeter technologies - Signal Extraction Technology (SET), and Resistor Calibration (RCAL) technology on 150 inborn, term neonates at birth. Probes of both pulse oximeters were connected to the pre-ductal limb and the time taken to obtain a reliable reading was recorded. Sequential saturation values were recorded every minute till ten minutes of life. Statistical analysis was done with Mann-Whitney U test and intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated. RESULTS Pulse oximeter with SET recorded reliable readings faster than RCAL technology - Median (IQR) 32 (21-60)s vs. 45 (21.75-105)s, p = 0.021. There was a significant difference in the time to record first saturation readings of the two pulse oximeters when used in normal deliveries [RCAL vs. SET-Median (IQR) 50s (25-120.75) vs. 32.5s (21.75-58.25), p = 0.004] but no such difference was observed in Lower Segment Cesarean section (LSCS) [RCAL vs. SET Median (IQR) 35.5s (18.25-70.75) vs. 31s (20-69.75), p = 0.968]. Sequential saturation readings for every minute for the first 10 min of life were higher with SET vs. RCAL technology. The intraclass correlation coefficient between both pulse oximeters, for each minute, was poor (r < 0.80). CONCLUSIONS The SET pulse oximeter picked up first saturation values faster than the RCAL technology pulse oximeters. Studies are needed to evaluate effect of this on decisions made during neonatal resuscitation.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
A systematic study of critical miRNAs on cells proliferation and apoptosis by the shortest path.,"BACKGROUND MicroRNAs are a class of important small noncoding RNAs, which have been reported to be involved in the processes of tumorigenesis and development by targeting a few genes. Existing studies show that the imbalance between cell proliferation and apoptosis is closely related to the initiation and development of cancers. However, the impact of miRNAs on this imbalance has not been studied systematically. RESULTS In this study, we first construct a cell fate miRNA-gene regulatory network. Then, we propose a systematical method for calculating the global impact of miRNAs on cell fate genes based on the shortest path. Results on breast cancer and liver cancer datasets show that most of the cell fate genes are perturbed by the differentially expressed miRNAs. Most of the top-identified miRNAs are verified in the Human MicroRNA Disease Database (HMDD) and are related to breast and liver cancers. Function analysis shows that the top 20 miRNAs regulate multiple cell fate related function modules and interact tightly based on their functional similarity. Furthermore, more than half of them can promote sensitivity or induce resistance to some anti-cancer drugs. Besides, survival analysis demonstrates that the top-ranked miRNAs are significantly related to the overall survival time in the breast and liver cancers group. CONCLUSION In sum, this study can help to systematically study the important role of miRNAs on proliferation and apoptosis and thereby uncover the key miRNAs during the process of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the results of this study will contribute to the development of clinical therapy based miRNAs for cancers.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Recent management advances in acute postoperative pain.,"INTRODUCTION Acute postoperative pain remains a major problem, with both undertreatment and overtreatment leading to serious consequences, including increased risk of persistent postoperative pain, impaired rehabilitation, increased length of stay and/or hospital readmission, and adverse events related to excessive analgesic use, such as oversedation. New analgesic medications and techniques have been introduced that target the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative periods to better manage acute postoperative pain, with improvements in analgesic efficacy and safety over more traditional pain management approaches. This review provides an overview of these new analgesic medications and techniques. Specific topics that are discussed include the use of preoperative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anxiolytics, and anticonvulsants; intraoperative approaches such as neuraxial analgesia, continuous local anesthetic wound infusion, transversus abdominis plane block, extended-release epidural morphine, intravenous acetaminophen, and intravenous ketamine; and postoperative use of intravenous ibuprofen, new opioids (eg, tapentadol) or opioid formulations (morphine-oxycodone), and patient-controlled analgesia. CONCLUSION New, targeted, analgesic medications and techniques may provide a safer and more effective approach to the management of acute postoperative pain than traditional approaches such as postoperative oral analgesics.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

[Clinical benefit of Tocilizumab and other immunomodulating agents for treatment of COVID-19]./ Klinischer Nutzen von Tocilizumab und anderen immunmodulatorischen Substanzen bei COVID-19,"The pathophysiological course of COVID-19 can be distinguished in a phase of viral replication and an inflammatory phase. Hyperinflammatory processes promote the development of severe COVID-19. Therefore, immunomodulating agents came into focus. Dexamethasone has already become standard of care for treatment of severe COVID-19. Two large randomized trials and a meta-analysis of collectively nine randomized trials showed a reduced mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 if Tocilizumab - an IL-6-rezeptor antagonist - was added to standard of care. Treatment with Baricitinib - a JAK 1/2 inhibitor - may also be beneficial for patients without or on low oxygen supplementation. National and international guidelines recommend Tocilizumab for treatment of severe COVID-19. Treatment with JAK inhibitors is an option for hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19. It should be emphasized that comedication of JAK inhibitors and Tocilizumab is not recommended. Further high quality research is required for the widespread use of immunomodulating agents in COVID-19.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Telehealth, associated changes in EHR use patterns, and implications for physician burnout in the ambulatory care setting","OBJECTIVES/GOALS: The objective of this study is to examine the associated changes in the EHR use patterns after the widespread implementation of telehealth in the ambulatory care setting after the COVID pandemic. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: The study sample will be all attending ambulatory care physicians at UCSF Health. Signal measures captured by Epic Systems are markers of EHR use pattern that characterize EHR use at the individual provider level in terms of time spent performing certain activities, time spent at particular times of the day, and the number of EHR tools being used. We will use the Single Interrupted Time Series framework to analyze the changes in Signal measures that occur after the widespread implementation of telehealth with pre-telehealth time period defined as Jan 2018 – Feb 2020 and post-telehealth time period defined as March 2020 – present. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: The outcomes of this study will reveal how the increased use of telehealth following the COVID pandemic has changed the way providers utilize various functions within EHR (e.g. time in EHR at particular time of day, documentation, medication and non-medication orders, chart review, etc). These results can, in turn, inform us potential impacts of increased telehealth use on physician burnout given that a number of markers of EHR use pattern (i.e. Signal measures) in previous studies have been associated with burnout. In addition, a stratified version of Interrupted Time Series by specialty and clinical work volume may inform us how different subgroups of providers exhibit varying EHR use patterns in response to the increased use of telehealth. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The use of telehealth will likely remain a strong presence in health care delivery in the post-COVID era. This study can serve as a baseline study on the influence of telehealth on EHR use. Future studies may focus on potential targeted interventions to best support the usage of telehealth.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Sustainable financing for new vaccines in Indonesia: Challenges and strategies,"Immunization is one of the most cost-effective interventions in global health and has a crucial role in achieving 14 of the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) The issue of sustainable financing for new vaccines is particularly pertinent as Indonesia transitions away from extensive Gavi support towards a self-financing immunization system As the current immunization system transitions, practical solutions must be found and applied to provide more flexibility in the budget for financing immunizations without sacrificing the current healthcare system’s needs Despite the fact that economic evaluation studies are essential as an initial step to ensure financial readiness, the lack of reliable data is the first barrier to Indonesia’s journey toward a self-financing immunization system To overcome this problem, standardization of data collection strategies and methodologies are required In particular, Indonesia may have to explore other options to increase revenue for its immunization system, such as through general revenue from the central government, a sector-wide approach to financing, and a national trust fund To deal with the tight immunization budget and its consequences, Indonesia also has to restructure its immunization system, which can be implemented through province block grants, insurance mandate and subsidy Taking the potential of a COVID-19 vaccine into account, the Indonesian government should consider a number of costs and issues beyond the development and procurement of vaccines The costs of delivering vaccines to the remote parts of Indonesia, implementing the necessary infrastructure, and modifying vaccine delivery are also important in this time of transition These constraints must be addressed in the new self-financing system and other public health efforts must be increased to decrease the burden of infectious disease as Indonesia develops a stronger immunization system © 2020, MDPI AG All rights reserved",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Attenuation of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury by adipose stem cell-derived exosome treatment via ERK1/2 and GSK-3β signaling pathways,"Exosomes are an emerging therapeutic tool for the treatment of tissue injuries. In the present study, the protective effect of isolated exosomes from adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs-exo) against hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury was explored. Hepatic I/R injury was achieved by inducing ischemia for 60 min followed by reperfusion for 2 and 6 h. Pre-treatment with ADSCs-exo revealed a significant reduction in necrosis and apoptosis in liver tissue induced by I/R injury. Hypoxic oxidative stress was managed by exosome-mediated reduced reactive oxygen species and increased superoxide dismutase that in turn protected mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. Reduction in inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β and TNF-α was also observed and protection of hepatocytes from I/R injury was evidenced by a significant decrease in biochemical markers of liver damage (alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase and lactate dehydrogenase). Exosomal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-mediated ERK1/2 and GSK-3β phosphorylation were revealed to increase Bcl-2 and decrease Bax expression with mitochondrial permeability transition pore-inhibition which may be considered a prime mechanism of exosome-mediated hepatoprotection. In conclusion, our results indicated that ADSCs-exo pre-treatment is effective in protecting liver I/R injury.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Information source and content: articulating two key concepts for information evaluation,"Purpose: Learning how to identify and avoid inaccurate information, especially disinformation, is essential for any informational consumer. Many information literacy tools specify criteria that can help users evaluate information more efficiently and effectively. However, the authors of these tools do not always agree on which criteria should be emphasized, what they mean or why they should be included in the tool. This study aims to clarify two such criteria (source credibility and soundness of content), which evolutionary cognitive psychology research emphasize. This paper uses them as a basis for building a question-based evaluation tool and draws implications for information literacy programs. Design/methodology/approach: This paper draws on cross-disciplinary scholarship (in library and information science, evolutionary cognitive psychology and rhetoric studies) to explore 15 approaches to information evaluation which conceptualizes source credibility and content soundness, two markers of information accuracy. This paper clarifies these two concepts, builds two sets of questions meant to elicit empirical indicators of information accuracy and deploys them against a recent piece of journalism which embeds a conspiracy theory about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper shows how the two standards can help us determine that the article is misleading. This paper draws implications for information literacy programs. Findings: The meanings of and relationships between source credibility and content soundness often diverge across the 15 approaches to information evaluation this paper analyzed. Conceptual analysis allowed the authors to articulate source credibility in terms of authority and trustworthiness, and content soundness in terms of plausibility and evidential support. These conceptualizations allow the authors to formulate two respective sets of appropriate questions, the answers to which are meant to function as empirical indicators for the two standards. Deploying this instrument provides us with the opportunity to understand why a certain article discussing COVID-19 is misleading. Originality/value: By articulating source credibility and content soundness as the two key criteria for evaluating information, together with guiding questions meant to elicit empirical indicators for them, this paper streamlines the process through which information users can judge the likelihood that a piece of information they encounter is accurate. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Correlation between Proinflammatory cytokines and severity of COVID-19 within Palestinian Population,"COVID-19 was characterized by cytokine storm and endothelial dysfunction in severely ill patients. As the severity of the infection was corelated with ethnicity, this study aimed to assess the correlation of proinflammatory cytokine serum level and COVID-19 symptoms within the Palestinian population. In cross-sectional study, serum samples of 27 non-hospitalized patients and 63 hospitalized patients SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, were tested for total antibodies, IL-6, TNF-, IFN-{gamma} and IL-1{beta} using the ELISA test. Results showed that most common symptoms within patients were Joint pain, cough, and fever (73.3%, 69.7% and 50% respectively). Serum total antibodies (IGs) levels in non-hospitalized patients were higher than hospitalized patients ((44.7 COI and 9.2 COI). TNF- and IL-6 were lower in non-hospitalized patients compared to hospitalized patients (48{+/-}17.9 pg/ml, 193.3{+/-}350.5 pg/ml respectively). On the other hand, IFN-{gamma}, in non-hospitalized patients (1{+/-}2 IU/ml) was significantly higher than hospitalized patients (0.4{+/-}0.26 IU/ml). IL-1{beta} was slightly lower in hospitalized patients (8.8{+/-}13.6 pg/ml) compared to non-hospitalized patients (12.5{+/-}24.5 pg/ml). Common mild symptoms of COVID-10 were negatively associated with proinflammatory cytokines serum level. In conclusion as it with other populations worldwide, IL-6 and TNF- are playing a major role in the complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Monitoring the two cytokines is crucial for management and treatment of complicated consequence of COVID-19.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Rapid popliteal artery release sensu A. N. Kazantsev in acute thrombosis in patients with COVID-19,"Aim. To analyze the outcomes of popliteal thrombectomy using the standard release technique with vascular instruments and rapid release sensu A. N. Kazantsev in patients with acute popliteal artery thrombosis (PAT) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Material and methods. The present prospective single-center study for the period from April 1, 2020 to March 17, 2021 included 157 patients with acute PAT and COVID-19 at the Alexandrovskaya City Hospital. All patients were divided into 2 groups depending on the popliteal artery access: group 1 (n=88;56%) — rapid release sensu A. N. Kazantsev;group 2 (n=69;44%) — standard popliteal artery release using vascular instruments (vascular forceps and scissors) and tourniquets. Rapid popliteal artery release was distinguished by the fact that fasciotomy and hemostasis, the fatty tissue behind it and up to the artery was torn with two index fingers. First, the fingers were joined together at the lateral edges and inserted into the wound middle. Then the wound together with tissues was stretched with fingers to proximal and distal edges until the popliteal artery was visualized. Further, a Beckmann retractor was used to fix the torn fiber to the upper and lower wound walls. The tourniquets were not used. Results. Surgical access duration (group 1, 4,5±1,3 minutes;group 2, 11,41±0,9 minutes;p=0,005), as well as the total procedure duration (group 1, 47,5±2,8 minutes;group 2, 62,15±4,5 min;p=0,001) had the lowest values in the group of rapid popliteal artery release. Moreover, all intraoperative bleedings (n=11;15,9%) was recorded in group 2 as a result of popliteal vein injuries and/or bleeding from popliteal artery. The retrombosis rate in the rapid release group was lower (group 1, 40,9%;group 2, 55,1%;p=0,03). On the first day after surgery, 18% of thrombosis developed in group 1, and 39% in group 2. The mortality rate was highest in the standard artery release group (group 1, 55,7%;group 2, 86,9%;p<0,0001;OR, 0,18;95% CI, 0,08-0,42). In all cases, the cause of death was systemic multiple organ failure due to severe pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and cytokine storm. Conclusion. The use of rapid popliteal artery release sensu A. N. Kazantsev significantly reduces the thrombectomy duration in the context of COVID-19. This effect is achieved due to a decrease in the incidence of intraoperative bleeding, no need to use tourniquets and vascular instruments. A decrease in the ischemia duration using novel release technique reduces the retrombosis rate, as well as deaths caused by systemic multiple organ failure against the background of hyperperfusion and compartment syndrome. Reducing the operation duration with the use of rapid popliteal artery release sensu A. N. Kazantsev reduces the time of intraoperative mechanical ventilation, which in COVID-19 patients reduces the risks of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, emphysema, and pulmonary embolism. Thus, the rapid popliteal artery release sensu A. N. Kazantsev can be recommended for popliteal thrombectomy in patients with COVID-19.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Hospitalization Rates in Patients with Heart Failure and Reduced Ejection Fraction Initiating Sacubitril/Valsartan or Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/Angiotensin Receptor Blockers: A Retrospective Cohort Study,"INTRODUCTION: The angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) sacubitril/valsartan (SAC/VAL) has shown benefit in patients with symptomatic heart failure (HF), including those naïve to renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi) therapy, and is considered the preferred RAASi for chronic HF. Real-world data on ARNI, specifically in RAASi-naïve patients, are limited. This study compared real-world outcomes of ARNI (SAC/VAL) vs. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy in RAASi-naïve patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included de-identified data on RAASi-naïve patients with HFrEF (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%) who had newly initiated SAC/VAL or ACEi/ARB between July 1, 2015, and March 31, 2019, from the Optum® Electronic Health Records database in the US. New SAC/VAL users were propensity score matched 1:2 with new ACEi/ARB users by pre-selected characteristics. One-year post-index rates of all-cause, HF, and cardiovascular hospitalizations and the composite of HF hospitalization or emergency room (ER) visits were measured using negative binomial regression. Time to first all-cause hospitalization, HF hospitalization, and composite of HF hospitalization or ER visits was measured using a subdistribution hazards model. RESULTS: The matched sample included 3059 new SAC/VAL and 6118 new ACEi/ARB users. Rates of all-cause hospitalization and composite of HF hospitalization or ER visits were significantly lower with SAC/VAL compared with ACEi/ARB (incidence rate ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.87 [0.81–0.93] and 0.87 [0.81–0.94], respectively), whereas rates of HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular hospitalizations were similar (1.00 [0.91–1.11] and 0.94 [0.87–1.02], respectively). Time-to-event analyses also showed a similar trend. CONCLUSIONS: In real-world clinical practice, RAASi-naïve patients with HFrEF initiating SAC/VAL were less likely to be hospitalized than those initiating ACEi/ARB, suggesting a potential for a reduced clinical and economic burden in these patients.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Precision epidemiology for infectious disease control,"Advances in genomics and computing are transforming the capacity for the characterization of biological systems, and researchers are now poised for a precision-focused transformation in the way they prepare for, and respond to, infectious diseases. This includes the use of genome-based approaches to inform molecular diagnosis and individual-level treatment regimens. In addition, advances in the speed and granularity of pathogen genome generation have improved the capability to track and understand pathogen transmission, leading to potential improvements in the design and implementation of population-level public health interventions. In this Perspective, we outline several trends that are driving the development of precision epidemiology of infectious disease and their implications for scientists’ ability to respond to outbreaks.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Social Media Exploration and Exploitation by Small and Medium Enterprises for Business Continuity,"This paper aims to examine social media usage by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the context of business continuity. A key concern for businesses in times of disasters, such as the COVID19 pandemic or hurricanes, is continuity. This is especially true for SMEs that lack the expertise, awareness, and ability to dedicate specific resources to disaster planning and management. SMEs are quick to explore social media for functions such as customer acquisition, perhaps due to greater flexibility and agility than large companies. However, SMEs are constrained by a lack of resources, limiting the extent to which they can exploit social media. We collect data from 68 SMEs and analyze the extent to which they explore and exploit social media tools. Our findings suggest that the firms fail to exploit their social media presence to leverage long-term strategic benefits, which would be helpful during a disaster. Our contribution includes ways to analyze social media exploration and exploitation and suggestions to strategically manage social media use for business continuity.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
False-positive HIV in a patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection; a case report,"INTRODUCTION: A small portion of Corona Virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases associated with co-infections, however occasionally they turn out to be false positive due to possible cross-reactivities. The current report aims to present a rare case of false-positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in a COVID-19 patient. CASE REPORT: A 32-year-old female complaining from thyroid problems referred for thyroid operation. She had mild symptoms of COVID-19. Her preoperative laboratory findings were normal, except for HIV screening test which was repetitively positive. RNA PCR was performed to confirm the diagnosis of HIV, it revealed a negative result. The patient underwent thyroidectomy as planned and was given the required supportive treatment to recover from COVID-19. Two-month follow up revealed that she was negative for COVID-19 on PCR testing, and HIV immunoassay test was no longer positive. DISCUSSION: Due to structural similarities between the spike protein chains of SARS-CoV-2 and some other viruses such as dengue, Zika, and other closely related coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), the protein can potentially interfere with the immunoassay tests. Although HIV immunoassay tests have high sensitivity and specificity, false-positive results have been reported, such as in the case of Epstein Barr virus, Influenza vaccination, and the Australian COVID-19 vaccination. CONCLUSION: Similarity between HIV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins can lead to antibody cross-reactivities, yielding false-positive results on immunoassay screening tests.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Optimizing direct RT-LAMP to detect transmissible SARS-CoV-2 from primary nasopharyngeal swab samples,"SARS-CoV-2 testing is crucial to controlling the spread of this virus, yet shortages of nucleic acid extraction supplies and other key reagents have hindered the response to COVID-19 in the US. Several groups have described loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays for SARS-CoV-2, including testing directly from nasopharyngeal swabs and eliminating the need for reagents in short supply. Frequent surveillance of individuals attending work or school is currently unavailable to most people but will likely be necessary to reduce the ~50% of transmission that occurs when individuals are nonsymptomatic. Here we describe a fluorescence-based RT-LAMP test using direct nasopharyngeal swab samples and show consistent detection in clinically confirmed primary samples with a limit of detection (LOD) of ~625 copies/μl, approximately 100-fold lower sensitivity than qRT-PCR. While less sensitive than extraction-based molecular methods, RT-LAMP without RNA extraction is fast and inexpensive. Here we also demonstrate that adding a lysis buffer directly into the RT-LAMP reaction improves the sensitivity of some samples by approximately 10-fold. Furthermore, purified RNA in this assay achieves a similar LOD to qRT-PCR. These results indicate that high-throughput RT-LAMP testing could augment qRT-PCR in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance programs, especially while the availability of qRT-PCR testing and RNA extraction reagents is constrained.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
To Curb the Progression of Fatal COVID-19 Course-Dream or Reality,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To analyze the impact of sodium retention states on the course of COVID-19 and propose possible interventions to curb disease progression. RECENT FINDINGS: Numerous data confirm a positive association of non-communicable diseases, aging, and other sodium-retaining states, including iatrogenic ones, with more severe sometimes fatal clinical course of COVID-19. Reasons for this effect could include increased angiotensin signaling via the AT1R receptor. The endothelial glycocalyx also plays an important role in infection, leading to a vicious cycle of inflammation and tissue sodium retention when damaged. RAS inhibitors may help restore glycocalyx function and prevent severe organ damage. Anticoagulants, especially heparin, may also have therapeutic applications due to antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, glycocalyx-repairing, and antialdosteronic properties. The ambiguous influence of some diuretics on sodium balance was also discussed. Abnormal sodium storage and increased angiotensin-converting enzyme activity are related to the severity of COVID-19. Inducing sodium removal and reducing intake might improve outcomes.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Colchicine and SARS-CoV-2: Management of the hyperinflammatory state,"The global COVID-19 pandemic is currently underway. In December 2020, the European Agency of Medicine (EMA) licensed the first Sars-CoV-2 vaccine. Therapeutic management of the COVID-19 positive patient should primarily aim to avoid the severe complications and organ injury caused by generalized inflammation caused by a cytokine storm and occurring in the most severe stages of viral infection. Current knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms of SARS- CoV-2 suggests a central role for exaggerated activation of the innate immune system as an important contributor to the adverse outcomes of COVID-19. Several studies have shown that blocking the cytokine storm or acting early with prevention of it can be effective; studies are underway to evaluate agents that may be able to reduce this hyperinflammatory state. The search for effective management strategies for COVID-19 continues to evolve. The actions of colchicine, one of the oldest anti-inflammatory therapies, target multiple targets associated with excessive COVID-19 inflammation. Colchicine is easily administered, generally well tolerated, and inexpensive. This article reports the scientific and molecular rationale for the use of colchicine as monotherapy or in combination in the various stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection to modulate and control the inflammatory state. Low-dose colchicine may be considered safe and effective for the treatment and prevention of cytokine storm in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly as an adjunctive remedy to other therapeutic agents. Well-organized clinical studies are needed in this direction.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for COVID-19: no evidence of effectiveness,"On 3 March 2020, the document 'Drug treatment options for patients with COVID-19 (infections with SARS-CoV-2)' was published on the website of the Dutch Working Party on Antibiotic Policy (Stichting Werkgroep Antibioticabeleid, SWAB) Based on a 7-step analysis of the literature, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) were initially included in the SWAB document as possible drug treatments for hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients However, recent weeks have seen the publication of the results of various studies into the effectiveness of treatment with HCQ and CQ in patients with COVID-19 On the basis of these results, we conclude that there is insufficient evidence to consider HCQ and CQ as meaningful treatment options in patients with COVID-19 Clinically relevant QTc prolongation occurs in at least 1 in 10 COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ or HQ",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
The Development of a Standardized Quality Assessment Material to Support Xpert(®) HIV-1 Viral Load Testing for ART Monitoring in South Africa,"The tiered laboratory framework for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load monitoring accommodates a range of HIV viral load testing platforms, with quality assessment critical to ensure quality patient testing. HIV plasma viral load testing is challenged by the instability of viral RNA. An approach using an RNA stabilizing buffer is described for the Xpert(®) HIV-1 Viral Load (Cepheid) assay and was tested in remote laboratories in South Africa. Plasma panels with known HIV viral titres were prepared in PrimeStore molecular transport medium for per-module verification and per-instrument external quality assessment. The panels were transported at ambient temperatures to 13 testing laboratories during 2017 and 2018, tested according to standard procedures and uploaded to a web portal for analysis. A total of 275 quality assessment specimens (57 verification panels and two EQA cycles) were tested. All participating laboratories met study verification criteria (n = 171 specimens) with an overall concordance correlation coefficient (ρ(c)) of 0.997 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.996 to 0.998) and a mean bias of −0.019 log copies per milliliter (cp/mL) (95% CI: −0.044 to 0.063). The overall EQA ρ(c) (n = 104 specimens) was 0.999 (95% CI: 0.998 to 0.999), with a mean bias of 0.03 log cp/mL (95% CI: 0.02 to 0.05). These panels are suitable for use in quality monitoring of Xpert(®) HIV-1 VL and are applicable to laboratories in remote settings.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Developing Strategy: A Guide For Nurse Managers to Manage Nursing Staff's Work-related Problems,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess nursing staff's work-related problems as perceived by their managers and thereafter develop strategies that would serve as a guide for nurse managers to manage these problems. METHODS: A descriptive research design was used. The participants included in the study consisted of the following two groups: Group 1-a convenience sample of 150 first-line managers working at three different hospitals; and Group 2-a panel of experts for the Delphi technique, selected using the Snowball sampling technique. Tools for data collection included the following: Tool 1-questionnaire about nursing staff's problems; Tool 2-Delphi technique to develop strategies for managing nursing staff's problems; and Tool 3-opinionnaire format. RESULTS: The recruited first nurse managers were of the opinion that job stress, work overload, conflict, workplace violence, poor performance, staff turnover, demotivation, lack of empowerment, and staff absenteeism were among the common problems faced by staff nurses at work. CONCLUSION: From the expert panelists' perspectives, the newly developed strategy in this study was considered valid; the researchers recommend the strategy developed in this study to be universalized in different health care settings and used as a guide for nurse managers.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Exploring the Mechanisms of Influence on COVID-19 Preventive Behaviors in China's Social Media Users,"The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) posed a powerful threat to human life. The preventive behaviors of individuals (e.g., home quarantine, disinfection, and wearing masks) play a key role in preserving and controlling the disease. In this case, as a motivational psychological system oriented toward avoiding infection, the behavioral immune system (BIS) may be activated and link to preventive behaviors. This study investigated the mechanisms through which emotional and cognitive processes resulted by BIS have promoted preventive behaviors in relation to COVID-19. We collected data on 22,005 active Sina Weibo users from 31 December 2019 to 8 February 2020 to measure their emotions (including disgust, happiness, and fear), cultural values (individualism and collectivism), moral concern (including purity vice, fairness vice, and authority virtue), and behavioral intentions (including isolation intention, protection intention, and aid intention) using Text Mind software and related dictionaries. Multiple regression and mediation analyses were performed to explore the relationships among variables. The results showed seven complete mediation paths (such as disgust-purity vice-protection intention). Each of these paths describes the effects of cognitive processes caused by BIS on preventive behaviors. We inferred that there may be path mechanisms such as disgust-cognitive processes-preventive behaviors. Using these results, policy makers can take appropriate measures to intervene in preventive behaviors (e.g., by posting disgusting images on social media to evoke disgust). The results can be used to explain differences in preventive behaviors among populations even in the face of similar thread levels. Furthermore, our research provides empirical evidence for the hypothesis of pathogen prevalence.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
The COVID-19 Cover-Up;How Federal Courts Are Changing Constitutional Law to Uphold Unconstitutional State Actions,"When a state deprives us of fundamental liberties, the judiciary is required to assess the government action using the strict scrutiny standard of review. Under this level of scrutiny, the state action must be narrowly tailored and serve a compelling state interest. An essential aspect of strict scrutiny is that the burden of proof is on the government. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, federal courts have largely failed to apply the strict scrutiny standard of review to state actions. Instead, courts have invented an entirely new standard of review specifically for state actions during a ‘public health crisis.’ Under this COVID-19 standard of review, courts may only overturn state actions that lack a real or substantial relation to public health or that amount to a plain, palpable invasion of rights. This judicial test shifts the burden of proof from the state to the individual. Unsurprisingly, the new COVID-19 standard of review vindicates state deprivations of liberty regardless of evidentiary based merit.This Article addresses the standard of judicial review federal courts are using to reject constitutional challenges to state actions in response to the coronavirus. This Article describes the fundamental liberties abridged by state lock-downs, and the judicial scrutiny historically applied to these types of infringements on liberty. This Article examines the 1905 Supreme Court case of Jacobson v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which courts utilize to support the new standard of judicial review developed during the COVID-19 pandemic. This Article reviews other legal precedents in the area of ‘quarantine law’ to expose how the COVID-19 standard of review is a radical divergence from traditional jurisprudence. Lastly, this Article compares federal court opinions using the new COVID-19 standard of review with the few court decisions still using strict scrutiny to review deprivations of liberty. This comparison demonstrates that once subjected to the appropriate level of judicial scrutiny and the burden of proof, state governments utterly fail to support the efficacy and necessity of their COVID-19 emergency measures.JUNE 2020 SUPPLEMENTAL UPDATE. Since the original publication of this Article on May 22, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court has seemingly announced its intent to support the unbridled discretion of state governments and further cover-up unconstitutional state actions in response to COVID-19. On May 29, 2020, the Supreme Court rejected an application for injunctive relief in South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom. This case involved California’s 25% occupancy restriction on churches, which exempted secular businesses from the same restrictions. The church challenged the constitutionality of California’s restriction under the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause and sought to enjoin its application. The Court’s denial of injunctive relief was a 5-4 split decision. Chief Justice Roberts concurred with the progressive block of justices in favor of the denial and authored an opinion in support of the decision. According to Justice Roberts, “[t]he precise question of when restrictions on particular social activities should be lifted during the pandemic is a dynamic and fact-intensive matter subject to reasonable disagreement. Our Constitution principally entrusts ‘[t]he safety and the health of the people’ to the politically accountable officials of the States ‘to guard and protect.’ Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 38, 25 S.Ct. 358, 49 L.Ed. 643 (1905).” Like the other judicial pronouncements discussed in this Article, this statement by Justice Roberts continues the federal judiciary’s campaign to defile constitutional law and declare the supremacy of state police power over the individual freedoms endowed to us by the Constitution. Contrary to Justice Robert’s determination, constitutional precedent holds that when government restrictions on fundamental rights are subject to reasonable disagreement (i.e., the government is not able to demonstrate the necessity of its actions), the judiciary must err on the side of liberty. Whatever authority our Constitution provides government officials to guard and protect the safety and health of the people is unquestionably subservient to our fundamental rights. Our Constitution PRINCIPALLY entrusts government with the unrivaled mandate to preserve the sacred rights of humanity.This is the way liberty ends, not with a bang, but with the whimper of faithless justices who dare to tell us that we are too stupid to understand the plainly stated constraints our Constitution places on government.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Responding to Intergenerational Food Security and Nutrition Education Needs With Remote Programming,"In-person intergenerational programming focused on nutrition education and healthy food access among older adults and preschool children in care settings was abandoned last year when COVID forced center closures. Food for a Long Life (FFLL), a 5-year community-based participatory research (CBPR) project, re-oriented programming in response to heightened community food insecurity and social isolation during COVID. With county Extension agents, FFLL modified and initiated new partnerships to expand food pantry services for several hundred families and deliver nutrition programming to youth (n=28) and older adult (n=130) participants in two states. In this presentation we share how the CBPR method supported adaptive programming and evaluation while continuing to advance project goals, including to promote the sustainability of an intergenerational food pantry and nutrition programming delivery after funding ends in summer 2021.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Relation of Serum Copper Status to Survival in COVID-19,"The trace element copper (Cu) is part of our nutrition and essentially needed for several cuproenzymes that control redox status and support the immune system. In blood, the ferroxidase ceruloplasmin (CP) accounts for the majority of circulating Cu and serves as transport protein. Both Cu and CP behave as positive, whereas serum selenium (Se) and its transporter selenoprotein P (SELENOP) behave as negative acute phase reactants. In view that coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causes systemic inflammation, we hypothesized that biomarkers of Cu and Se status are regulated inversely, in relation to disease severity and mortality risk. Serum samples from COVID-19 patients were analysed for Cu by total reflection X-ray fluorescence and CP was quantified by a validated sandwich ELISA. The two Cu biomarkers correlated positively in serum from patients with COVID-19 (R = 0.42, p < 0.001). Surviving patients showed higher mean serum Cu and CP concentrations in comparison to non-survivors ([mean+/-SEM], Cu; 1475.9+/-22.7 vs. 1317.9+/-43.9 µg/L; p < 0.001, CP; 547.2.5 +/- 19.5 vs. 438.8+/-32.9 mg/L, p = 0.086). In contrast to expectations, total serum Cu and Se concentrations displayed a positive linear correlation in the patient samples analysed (R = 0.23, p = 0.003). Serum CP and SELENOP levels were not interrelated. Applying receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, the combination of Cu and SELENOP with age outperformed other combinations of parameters for predicting risk of death, yielding an AUC of 95.0%. We conclude that the alterations in serum biomarkers of Cu and Se status in COVID-19 are not compatible with a simple acute phase response, and that serum Cu and SELENOP levels contribute to a good prediction of survival. Adjuvant supplementation in patients with diagnostically proven deficits in Cu or Se may positively influence disease course, as both increase in survivors and are of crucial importance for the immune response and antioxidative defence systems.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Promoting Patient and Nurse Safety in Acute Dialysis Units Through Advocacy and Collaboration,"Hospitals face the increasing challenge of balancing the need to provide quality care with that of being cost-effective. While guidelines and benchmarks for quality care exist in many areas within the hospital, those guidelines can be lacking for the acute (inpatient) dialysis setting. Nephrology nurses working in this setting may provide hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, continuous kidney replacement therapy, and apheresis treatments at the patient's bedside and in an acute dialysis unit.

Experimental Data and PBPK Modeling Quantify Antibody Interference in PEGylated Drug Carrier Delivery,"Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is a popular drug development tool that integrates physiology, drug physicochemical properties, preclinical data, and clinical information to predict drug systemic disposition. Since PBPK models seek to capture complex physiology, parameter uncertainty and variability is a prevailing challenge: there are often more compartments (e.g., organs, each with drug flux and retention mechanisms, and associated model parameters) than can be simultaneously measured. To improve the fidelity of PBPK modeling, one approach is to search and optimize within the high-dimensional model parameter space, based on experimental time-series measurements of drug distributions. Here, we employ Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) on a PBPK model of PEG-liposomes (PL) that tracks biodistribution in an 8-compartment mouse circulatory system, in the presence (APA+) or absence (naïve) of anti-PEG antibodies (APA). Near-continuous experimental measurements of PL concentration during the first hour post-injection from the liver, spleen, kidney, muscle, lung, and blood plasma, based on PET/CT imaging in live mice, are used as truth sets with LHS to infer optimal parameter ranges for the full PBPK model. The data and model quantify that PL retention in the liver is the primary differentiator of biodistribution patterns in naïve versus APA+ mice, and spleen the secondary differentiator. Retention of PEGylated nanomedicines is substantially amplified in APA+ mice, likely due to PL-bound APA engaging specific receptors in the liver and spleen that bind antibody Fc domains. Our work illustrates how applying LHS to PBPK models can further mechanistic understanding of the biodistribution and antibody-mediated clearance of specific drugs.

Efficacy and safety of the novel electrosurgical vessel sealing and cutting instrument BiCision®.,"BACKGROUND The use of energy-based tissue-sealing and cutting instruments is becoming more and more popular in visceral, urological, and gynecological surgery. For their safe and efficacious use in clinical practice, such instruments have to reliably seal vessels with a minimal sealing failure rate, cause minimal thermal damage to adjacent tissue, and have good cutting qualities. METHODS The efficacy and safety of the novel energy-based instrument for dissection, hemostasis and cutting (BiCision(®), ERBE) was compared to a commercially available device (EnSeal(®), Ethicon Endo-Surgery). We investigated vessel-sealing reliability (success rate), sealing quality and sealing time, lateral thermal damage cutting quality, tissue sticking to the instrument, burst pressure and delayed complications in an acute and chronic pig model after splenectomy, small bowel resection, nephrectomy, salpingo-oophorectomy, and sealing of peripheral vessels. RESULTS For all parameters investigated, BiCision(®) was at least equivalent to EnSeal(®). BiCision(®) was even superior to EnSeal(®) with respect to the burst pressure in arteries (p = 0.044) and veins (p = 0.023) and the cut quality in all locations (arteries, p = 0.0009; veins, p = 0.043). The course of the 7-day chronic study was uneventful except for one animal that developed an intestinal obstruction. None of the animals showed any signs of postoperative bleeding. On second-look laparotomy at day 7, macroscopic inspection of the sealed tissue and vessels did not show any signs of complications or evidence that bleeding had occurred. Histologically, the integrity of vessel wall fusion, thermal alterations, and inflammatory reactions were comparable, confirming substantial equivalence. CONCLUSION We demonstrated that the efficacy and quality of vessel sealing with BiCision(®) is at least equivalent to those of EnSeal(®) for vessel diameters up to 7 mm. Since EnSeal(®) has already been shown to be safe in clinical practice, BiCision(®) should be as reliable as EnSeal(®) under clinical conditions.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
[The characteristics of reproductive demographic processes in economically developed countries in conditions of COVID-19 pandemic: international publications review],"The article presents current trends in reproductive demographic process economically developed countries. Today, the total fertility rate in all European countries is below the minimum required to ensure population reproduction in long term - 2.1 children per woman during her life. According statistic data, 4.167 million children were born in the EU in 2019 that corresponds to 9.3 births per 1000 of population. In the EU, 1.53 children went to one woman in 2019 (in 2018 - 1.54). The lowest total fertility rates in 2019 were registered in Malta (1.14), Spain (1.23) and Italy (1.27). In the United States, fall of rate of childless women with higher education disputes well-established observation of positive relationship between education and childlessness. The infertility affects approximately 8-12% of couples worldwide, at that in developed countries, up to 15% of all couples are infertile. In connection with the problem of birth rate reduction in developed countries, researchers highlight such problems as increasing of average age of mothers at delivery (30-35 years and older) and intervals between labors, development of subsidiary reproductive technologies, pregnancy outcomes, newborns health in short and long perspective. The global COVID-19 pandemic resulted in resources deficiency, complexities with medical services support related to reproductive health, risks for maternal and perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19.

"Generalized anxiety disorder, depressive symptoms and sleep quality during COVID-19 outbreak in China: a web-based cross-sectional survey","China has been severely affected by Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) since December, 2019. We aimed to assess the mental health burden of Chinese public during the outbreak, and to explore the potential influence factors. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 7,236 self-selected volunteers assessed with demographic information, COVID-19 related knowledge, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), depressive symptoms, and sleep quality. The overall prevalence of GAD, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality of the public were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. Younger people reported a significantly higher prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms than older people. Compared with other occupational group, healthcare workers were more likely to have poor sleep quality. Multivariate logistic regression showed that age (< 35 years) and time spent focusing on the COVID-19 (&#8805; 3 hours per day) were associated with GAD, and healthcare workers were at high risk for poor sleep quality. Our study identified a major mental health burden of the public during the COVID-19 outbreak. Younger people, people spending too much time thinking about the outbreak, and healthcare workers were at high risk of mental illness. Continuous surveillance of the psychological consequences for outbreaks should become routine as part of preparedness efforts worldwide.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Is childcare cost a barrier to women managers' retention and progress at large firms?,"Purpose: The impact of childcare cost and childcare responsibilities has generally negatively impacted women in workforce. There has been lack of research on the impact of childcare on women managers in larger US public firms. The purpose of this paper is to determine how childcare costs impact the number of women managers in S&P 500 firms. Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs Driscoll–Kraay panel regression model using childcare data for ten years and the percent of women managers at S&P 500 firms. Findings: The results show that increase in childcare cost leads to decrease in percent of women in management positions when the child is an infant. Interestingly, but plausibly the results also show that for preschool-age children as the cost of childcare increases, there is an increase in percent of women in management. Furthermore, childcare costs are still an impediment to careers of women managers, specifically when the child is an infant. The effect is much less when the child grows from an infant to preschool age. Research limitations/implications: One limitation of this research paper is that the childcare cost data is not directly from the S&P 500 firms. The percent of women management data used is limited to the largest S&P 500 firms. Also, there is no agreement as to definition of a manager at these firms. Moreover, not only childcare cost, but the quality and availability of childcare are factors that also play a role in decision to work and/or use of childcare. Originality/value: This paper adds to the existing literature by providing evidence that childcare cost impedes women managers' career growth. This finding is more worrisome given that Covid-19 has had a very disproportionate impact on women with child(dren) in the workforce. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Prospective study of respiratory viral infections in pediatric hemopoietic stem cell transplantation patients.,"BACKGROUND Community-acquired respiratory viruses are an important cause of respiratory disease in pediatric patients undergoing hemopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, there are no studies examining the impact of more rapid and sensitive diagnosis by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in this population. We performed a prospective study to assess the impact of real time PCR diagnosis as well as protective isolation for community-acquired respiratory virus infections in pediatric patients undergoing hemopoietic stem cell transplantation. METHODS During a 2-year period, 39 pediatric patients undergoing hemopoietic stem cell transplantation were analyzed for presence of respiratory viruses. Samples were taken at regular intervals and analyzed by culture and newly developed real time PCR methods. All patients were cared for in protective isolation. RESULTS Respiratory symptoms were observed in 10 of the 39 cases (26%) and a virus was identified in 8 and 6 of these cases by PCR and culture, respectively. The PCR detected the respiratory infection a median of 8 days before culture. However, the morbidity of the respiratory infections was generally mild, and no mortality was observed. Additionally all infections were observed pretransplant or after discharge; no nosocomial infections were observed. CONCLUSIONS The real time PCR assay is more rapid and sensitive than culture and could be used to screen patients before transplant or as respiratory symptoms present for timely diagnosis.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
A Double-Edged Sword-Cardiovascular Concerns of Potential Anti-COVID-19 Drugs,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic infection caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 significantly affects multiple systems including the cardiovascular system. Most importantly, in addition to the direct injury from the virus per se, the subsequent cytokine storm, an overproduction of immune cells and their activating compounds, causes devastating damage. To date, emerging anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatments are warranted to control epidemics. Several candidate drugs have been screened and are currently under investigation. These primarily include antiviral regimens and immunomodulatory regimens. However, beyond the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects, these drugs may also have risks to the cardiovascular system, especially altering cardiac conduction. Herein, we review the cardiovascular risks of potential anti-COVID-19 drugs.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Sol-Gel ceramic glazes with photocatalytic activity,"A frit is a glassy ceramic composition that has been fused, quenched, and granulated. A single frit or a mixture of frits and ceramic materials forms a ceramic glaze. The purpose of this pre-fusion is to render any soluble and/or toxic components insoluble by rendering it inert in a glassy composition with silica and other added oxides. The ceramic glaze dispersed in water (ceramic slip) is deposited on a ceramic body and fired for waterproofing and aesthetic purposes. Multicomponent frits (zinc-potassium borosilicate system) with similar behavior to conventional ceramic frits for single-firing ceramic glazes (“monoporosa” glazes fired at 1080 °C) were prepared by Sol-Gel methods (monophasic and polyphasic gels) avoiding the pre-fusion and characterized as photocatalytic agents (showing high degradation activity on Orange II).

Complete pulmonary recovery after COVID-19 infection requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: A case report,"Severe pulmonary complications associated with COVID-19 infections are a substantial source of morbidity and/or mortality. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been shown to be a potentially useful therapy in the management of severe COVID-19 infection as a means to facilitate pulmonary recovery. Despite growing evidence to demonstrate the utility of ECMO for COVID-19 respiratory failure, little is known regarding the posthospital discharge recovery and functional status of these patients. Furthermore, concerns regarding potential long-term complications, but data are lacking. We illustrate a case of a previously healthy male, who was supported on ECMO for severe COVID-19 who demonstrated what appears to be a complete subjective and objective pulmonary recovery within a short time postdischarge. Our case provides some optimisms that critically-ill COVID-19 patients might recover completely and be able to return to functional lives.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

"To Battle COVID-19's Twin Economic and Health Crises, Medicaid Needs Flexible Funding Structures for Stabilization","Medicaid, which provides health insurance to low-income Americans, is a joint federal-state partnership that manifests as 50 unique state programs. States have policy flexibility to design programs within federal parameters. However, Medicaid also requires funding flexibility to encourage states to maintain services during times of crisis when more people need Medicaid. Currently, Medicaid's funding formula, the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), adjusts federal spending by state levels of economic development but fails to adjust for nationwide recessions. During economic contractions, the federal government should use its ability to run budget deficits to reimburse states at higher rates in exchange for maintaining services. In turn, during economic expansions, states should shoulder relatively more costs of Medicaid. Although the current FMAP boost provided under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act has reduced strain on state Medicaid programs, it does not account for the severity of state-specific downturns and is limited to the current emergency. Instead of ad hoc, across-the-board FMAP boosts to respond to each crisis, Congress should pass legislation making automatic adjustments based on changes in state unemployment rates.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

"Key dimer interface residues impact the catalytic activity of 3CLpro, the main protease of SARS-CoV-2","3C-like protease (3CLpro) is one of two proteases that process and liberate functional viral proteins essential for the maturation and infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19. It has been suggested that 3CLpro is catalytically active as a dimer, making the dimerization interface a target for antiviral development. Guided by structural analysis, here we introduced single amino acid substitutions at nine residues at three key sites of the dimer interface to assess their impact on dimerization and activity. We show that at site 1, alanine substitution of S1 or E166 increased by 2-fold or reduced relative activity, respectively. At site 2, alanine substitution of S10 or E14 eliminated activity, whereas K12A exhibited ∼60% relative activity. At site 3, alanine substitution of R4, E290, or Q299 eliminated activity, whereas S139A exhibited 46% relative activity. We further found the oligomerization states of the dimer interface mutants varied;the inactive mutants R4A, R4Q, S10A/C, E14A/D/Q/S, E290A, and Q299A/E were present as dimers, demonstrating that dimerization is not an indication of catalytically active 3CLpro. In addition, present mostly as monomers, K12A displayed residual activity, which could be attributed to the conspicuous amount of dimer present. Finally, differential scanning calorimetry did not reveal a direct relationship between the thermodynamic stability of mutants with oligomerization or catalytic activity. These results provide insights on two allosteric sites, R4/E290 and S10/E14, that may promote the design of antiviral compounds that target the dimer interface rather than the active site of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Weight loss interventions for Hispanic women in the USA: a protocol for a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND In the U.S., Hispanic women experience a disproportionate rate of obesity and obesity-related chronic diseases. At the same time, Hispanic women remain considerably underrepresented in behavioral weight loss interventions. The purpose of this review is to systematically evaluate the evidence related to the effectiveness of weight loss interventions among Hispanic women in the U.S. This review will identify elements of successful weight loss interventions as well as areas for future research. METHODS/DESIGN The following databases will be searched to identify all relevant articles (from inception onwards): PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science (Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index), PsycINFO, CINAHL, Chicano Database, SPORTDiscus, CAB Abstracts, and Google Scholar. We will include randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies of adult women (> 18 years) from Hispanic/Latino background living in the United States. Eligible interventions will target weight-related behaviors (including diet, physical activity, behavior modification and/or their combinations). The review's primary outcome will be weight change (expressed as change in lbs/kg or body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2)). Three reviewers will independently screen and select data and two will extract data. The methodological quality (or risk of bias) of individual studies will be appraised using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool. A narrative synthesis will describe quality and content of the evidence. DISCUSSION The aim of this systematic review is to critically examine existing weight loss interventions for Hispanic women in the U.S. and provide quality evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions on weight loss. Further, this review seeks to identify characteristics of effective interventions and suggest future directions for research efforts targeting weight loss in this population. This review will inform the development of future weight loss interventions for this population.

From Nano Backlash to Public Indifference: Some Reflections on French Public Dialogues on Nanotechnology,"The hype surrounding the emergence of nanotechnology proved extremely effective to raise public attention and controversies in the early 2000s. A proactive attitude prevailed resulting in the integration of social scientists upstream at the research level, research programs on Ethical, Legal and Societal Impacts (ELSI), and various public engagement initiatives such as nanojury and citizen conferences. Twenty years later, what happened to the promises of SHS integration and public engagement in nanotechnology? Was it part of the hype, one of the many promises made by the champions of nanotechnology initiatives that never materialized? As a contribution to this broad question, this paper focuses on public engagement initiatives in France and ventures some general reflections on their fate. I will first report, from an insider’s perspective, the public debates conducted by a civil society organization VivAgora, in the national context of fierce controversies (2005–2009). Then I will describe the permanent forum NanoRESP opened in 2013 when nano controversies waned out. On the basis of this case study, I will argue that the STS ideal of co-production of science and society gradually gave way to a more modest co-learning process between stakeholders in the 2010s.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Methods: In total, 29 athletes were recruited by social media and in clubs. Participants responded to a questionnaire on health behavior and mental health and completed diet registration and a DXA-scan. Results: Most athletes started combat sports to feel empowered and experienced an inclusive milieu, but the frequency of health issues was high. A total of 21–67% had symptoms of ED, suffered from injuries, had low site-specific BMD, and/or symptoms of LEA. Athletes had insufficient intake of energy and nutrients, and <50% received any dietary information or guidance from their clubs. Most athletes complied with favorable weight-loss strategies; still, >20% used unfavorable methods and rapid weight-loss periods. A total of 70% of the athletes had experienced SH, of which 41% experienced SH within the combat-sport context. Conclusion: Combat sport offers an inclusive milieu, which may increase women’s health and confidence; still, our results indicates a need for actions to safeguard female combat-sport athletes’ mental and physical health, implying a cultural change within the community of combat sport and a need for increased health and nutrition literacy.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Learning from HIV-1 to predict the immunogenicity of T cell epitopes in SARS-COV-2,"We describe a physics-based learning model for predicting the immunogenicity of Cytotoxic-T-Lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes derived from diverse pathogens including SARS-CoV-2. The model was trained and optimized on the relative immunodominance of CTL epitopes in Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection. Its accuracy was tested against experimental data from COVID-19 patients. Our model predicts that only some SARS-CoV-2 epitopes predicted to bind to HLA molecules are immunogenic. The immunogenic CTL epitopes across all SARS-CoV-2 proteins are predicted to provide broad population coverage, but those from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone are unlikely to do so. Our model also predicts that several immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 CTL epitopes are identical to seasonal coronaviruses circulating in the population and such cross-reactive CD8+ T cells can indeed be detected in prepandemic blood donors, suggesting that some level of CTL immunity against COVID-19 may be present in some individuals prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the injectable anaesthetic alfaxalone in the horse.,"OBJECTIVE To determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the neurosteroidal anaesthetic, alfaxalone, in horses after a single intravenous (IV) injection of alfaxalone, following premedication with acepromazine, xylazine and guaiphenesin. STUDY DESIGN Prospective experimental study. ANIMALS Ten (five male and five female), adult, healthy, Standardbred horses. METHODS Horses were premedicated with acepromazine (0.03 mg kg(-1) IV). Twenty minutes later they received xylazine (1 mg kg(-1) IV), then after 5 minutes, guaiphenesin (35 mg kg(-1) IV) followed immediately by IV induction of anaesthesia with alfaxalone (1 mg kg(-1) ). Cardiorespiratory variables (pulse rate, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry) and clinical signs of anaesthetic depth were evaluated throughout anaesthesia. Venous blood samples were collected at strategic time points and plasma concentrations of alfaxalone were assayed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and analysed by noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis. The quality of anaesthetic induction and recovery was scored on a scale of 1-5 (1 very poor, 5 excellent). RESULTS The median (range) induction and recovery scores were 4 (3-5) (good: horse slowly and moderately gently attained recumbency with minimal or no rigidity or paddling) and 4 (1-5) (good: horse stood on first attempt with some knuckling and ataxia) respectively. The monitored cardiopulmonary variables were within the range expected for clinical equine anaesthesia. The mean ± SD durations of anaesthesia from induction to sternal recumbency and from induction to standing were 42.7 ± 8.4 and 47 ± 9.6 minutes, respectively. The mean ± SD plasma elimination half life (t(1/2) ), plasma clearance (Clp) and volume of distribution (V(d) ) for alfaxalone were 33.4 minutes, 37.1 ± 11.1 mL minute(-1) kg(-1) and 1.6 ± 0.4 L kg(-1) , respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Alfaxalone, in a 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin formulation, provides anaesthesia with a short duration of recumbency that is characterised by a smooth induction and satisfactory recovery in the horse. As in other species, alfaxalone is rapidly cleared from the plasma in the horse.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Effect of strength training programs on front push kick dynamics and kinematics,"The general fitness requirements for any combat activity include the flexibility, speed, power, muscular endur-ance, aerobic capacity, muscular strength, agility, balance, coordination, and body composition. In addition, the development of these fitness component should support and not disrupt the development and practice of combat techniques The aim of this study was knowledge about the effects of two programs of strength training on front push kick dynamics and kinematics across different loading conditions (no-load up to 45kg of external load) in professional soldiers. Sixteen professional military personnel were randomized into two groups who performed an 8-week inter-vention program focused either on functional training with a core emphasis (FCE: 26.8 ±10.1 years, 84.2 ±5.4 kg, 181.1 ±6.4 cm) or traditional strength preparation (TSP: 26.8 ±10.1 years, 84.2 ±5.4 kg, 181.1 ±6.4 cm). Both groups performed 5 front push kicks into a force plate across 5 different loading conditions and forces and kinematics were measured. The main differences in the performance of the front push kicks after FCE were that impulse increased by 16% and the impact time of the front kicks were prolonged by 10% whereas after TSP the peak force was increased by 20% and the angular velocity of the knee by 13%. Both training programs promoted changes in the coordination of movement as quantified by principal component analysis. The FCE should be included in training close combat to increase impulse of the front push kick and TSP should be included to increase the peak force and the angular velocity of the knee. The combination of FCE and TSP should be used in training as both could improve kicking performance. © 2021, the Authors.

Overview of the epidemiological conditions of HIV among key populations in Africa,"INTRODUCTION: Despite extraordinary progress in HIV treatment coverage and expanding access to HIV prevention services and that multiple African countries are on track in their efforts to reach 90‐90‐90 goals, the epidemic continues to persist, with prevalence and incidence rates too high in some parts of the continent to achieve epidemic control. While data sources are improving, and research studies on key populations in specific contexts have improved, work on understanding the HIV burdens and barriers to services for these populations remains sparse, uneven and absent altogether in multiple settings. More data have become available in the last several years, and data published in 2010 or more recently are reviewed here for each key population. This scoping review assesses the current epidemiology of HIV among key populations in Africa and the social and political environments that contribute to the epidemic, both of which suggest that without significant policy reform, these epidemics will likely continue. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Across Africa, the HIV epidemic is most severe among key populations including women and men who sell or trade sex, men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, transgender women who have sex with men and prisoners and detainees. These groups account for the majority of new infections in West and Central Africa, and an estimated 25% of new infections in East and Southern Africa, despite representing relatively small proportions of those populations. The HIV literature in Africa emphasizes that despite significant health needs, key populations experience barriers to accessing services within the healthcare and legal justice systems. Current shortcomings of surveillance systems in enumerating key populations impact the way funding mechanisms and resources are allocated and distributed. Adapting more equitable and epidemiologically sound frameworks will be necessary for current and future HIV programming investments. CONCLUSIONS: Through this review, the available literature on HIV epidemiology among key populations in Africa brings to light a number of surveillance, programmatic and research gaps. For many communities, interventions targeting the health and security conditions continue to be minimal. Compelling evidence suggests that sweeping policy and programmatic changes are needed to effectively tackle the persistent HIV epidemic in Africa.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Implementation of an electronic patient-reported measure of barriers to antiretroviral therapy adherence with the Opal patient portal: Protocol for a mixed method type 3 hybrid pilot study at a large Montreal HIV clinic,"BACKGROUND: Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) remains problematic. Regular monitoring of its barriers is clinically recommended, however, patient-provider communication around adherence is often inadequate. Our team thus decided to develop a new electronically administered patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) of barriers to ART adherence (the I-Score) to systematically capture this data for physician consideration in routine HIV care. To prepare for a controlled definitive trial to test the I-Score intervention, a pilot study was designed. Its primary objectives are to evaluate patient and physician perceptions of the I-Score intervention and its implementation strategy. METHODS: This one-arm, 6-month study will adopt a mixed method type 3 implementation-effectiveness hybrid design and be conducted at the Chronic Viral Illness Service of the McGill University Health Centre (Montreal, Canada). Four HIV physicians and 32 of their HIV patients with known or suspected adherence problems will participate. The intervention will involve having patients complete the I-Score through a smartphone application (Opal), before meeting with their physician. Both patients and physicians will have access to the I-Score results, for consideration during the clinic visits at Times 1, 2 (3 months), and 3 (6 months). The implementation strategy will focus on stakeholder involvement, education, and training; promoting the intervention’s adaptability; and hiring an Application Manager to facilitate implementation. Implementation, patient, and service outcomes will be collected (Times 1-2-3). The primary outcome is the intervention’s acceptability to patients and physicians. Qualitative data obtained, in part, through physician focus groups (Times 2–3) and patient interviews (Times 2–3) will help evaluate the implementation strategy and inform any methodological adaptations. DISCUSSION: This study will help plan a definitive trial to test the efficacy of the I-Score intervention. It will generate needed data on electronic PROM interventions in routine HIV care that will help improve understanding of conditions for their successful implementation.

Volatility Spillovers between Major International Financial Markets During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"This paper studies the dynamic change of volatility spillovers between several major international financial markets during the global COVID-19 pandemic using Diebold and Yilmaz’s connectedness index. We found that the total volatility spillover in this March reached its highest level of recent ten years, while the pandemic developed to its worst stage in this April. Results of total directional spillover show that American and British stock markets are main spillover transmitters during the pandemic, while Chinese and Japanese stock markets, as well as GBP/USD exchange rate are spillover recipients. The pairwise directional spillover between American and British stock markets is larger than other pairs. GBP/USD exchange rate and WTI crude oil futures market mainly receive spillovers from American stock market. Results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused huge shocks to international financial markets, especially of those countries with severe pandemics, and the pandemic led to increased spillovers between financial markets.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Impact of the Inflow Population From Outbreak Areas on the COVID-19 Epidemic in Yunnan Province and the Recommended Control Measures: A Preliminary Study,"Background: COVID-19 developed into a global pandemic in 2020 and poses challenges regarding the prevention and control capabilities of countries. A large number of inbound travelers from other regions could lead to a renewed outbreak of COVID-19 in the local regions. Globally, as a result of the imbalance in the control of the epidemic, all countries are facing the risk of a renewed COVID-19 outbreak brought about by travelers from epidemic areas. Therefore, studies on a proper management of the inbound travelers are urgent. Methods: We collected a total of 4,733,414 inbound travelers and 174 COVID-19 diagnosed patients in Yunnan province from 21 January 2020 to 20 February 2020. Data on place of origin, travel history, age, and gender, as well as whether they had suspected clinical manifestations for inbound travelers in Yunnan were collected. The impact of inbound travelers on the local epidemic was analyzed with a collinear statistical analysis and the effect of the control measures on the epidemic was evaluated with a sophisticated modeling approach. Results: Of the 174 COVID-19 patients, 60.9% were not from Yunnan, and 76.4% had a history of travel in Hubei. The amount of new daily cases in Yunnan was significant correlated with the number of inbound travelers from Hubei and suspected cases among them. Using Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model analysis, we found that the prevention and control measures dropped the local R0 down to 1.07 in Yunnan province. Conclusions: Our preliminary analysis showed that the proper management of inbound travelers from outbreak areas has a significantly positive effect on the prevention and control of the virus. In the process of resettlement, some effective measures taken by Yunnan province may provide an important reference for preventing the renewed COVID-19 outbreak in other regions.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Presentation of COVID-19 in a liver transplant recipient,"Diarrhea is common after liver transplant. Although the majority of episodes are experienced during the first year of transplantation, they can occur any time after the procedure. Diarrhea can impose a major risk of morbidity and mortality on transplanted patients;so a careful evaluation is required to manage it. There are few studies highlighting the gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19, in particular among immunosuppressed patients.

Mask-associated ‘de novo’ headache in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic,"OBJECTIVES: The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus (COVID-19) has changed care activities of health professionals. We analysed the possible association between the appearance of ‘de novo’ headache according to the type of mask used, the related factors and the impact of the cephalalgia on health professionals. METHODS: Cross-sectional study in a tertiary hospital in Extremadura, Spain. We provided an online questionnaire to healthcare workers during the period of maximum incidence of COVID-19 in our setting. RESULTS: The subjects are n=306, 244 women (79.7%), with an average age of 43 years (range 23–65). Of the total, 129 (42.2%) were physicians, 112 (36.6%) nurses and 65 (21.2%) other health workers. 208 (79.7%) used surgical masks and 53 (20.3%) used filter masks. Of all those surveyed, 158 (51.6%) presented ‘de novo’ headache. The occurrence of a headache was independently associated with the use of a filter mask, OR 2.14 (95% CI 1.07 to 4.32); being a nurse, OR 2.09 (95% CI 1.18 to 3.72) or another health worker, OR 6.94 (95% CI 3.01 to 16.04); or having a history of asthma, OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.89). According to the type of mask used, there were differences in headache intensity, and the impact of a headache in the subjects who used a filter mask was worse in all the aspects evaluated. CONCLUSION: The appearance of ‘de novo’ headache is associated with the use of filter masks and is more frequent in certain healthcare workers, causing a greater occupational, family, personal and social impact.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
A Multimodal Multi-Institutional Solution to Remote Medical Student Education for Otolaryngology During COVID-19.,"During the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, there has been a surge in production of remote learning materials for continued otolaryngology resident education. Medical students traditionally rely on elective and away subinternship experiences for exposure to the specialty. Delays and cancellation of clinical rotations have forced medical students to pursue opportunities outside of the traditional learning paradigm. In this commentary, we discuss the multi-institutional development of a robust syllabus for medical students using a multimodal collection of resources. Medical students collaborated with faculty and residents from 2 major academic centers to identify essential otolaryngology topics. High-quality, publicly available, and open-access content from multiple sources were incorporated into a curriculum that appeals to a variety of learners. Multimodal remote education strategies can be used as a foundation for further innovation aimed at developing tomorrow's otolaryngologists.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Agnoprotein of mammalian polyomaviruses,"Polyomaviruses are naked viruses with an icosahedral capsid that surrounds a circular double-stranded DNA molecule of about 5000 base-pairs. Their genome encodes at least five proteins: large and small tumor antigens and the capsid proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3. The tumor antigens are expressed during early stages of the viral life cycle and are implicated in the regulation of viral transcription and DNA replication, while the capsid proteins are produced later during infection. Members of the Polyomaviridae family have been isolated in birds (Avipolyomavirus) and mammals (Orthopolyomavirus and Wukipolyomavirus). Some mammalian polyomaviruses encode an additional protein, referred to as agnoprotein, which is a relatively small polypeptide that exerts multiple functions. This review discusses the structure, post-translational modifications, and functions of agnoprotein, and speculates why not all polyomaviruses express this protein.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Age-Dependent Risks of Incidence and Mortality of COVID-19 in Hubei Province and Other Parts of China,"The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of early 2020 poses an enormous challenge to global public health. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the virus has spread rapidly throughout the world, taking thousands of lives in just over 2 months. It is critical to refine the incidence and mortality risks of COVID-19 for the effective management of the general public and patients during the outbreak. In this report, we investigate the incidence and mortality risks of the infection by analyzing the age composition of 5,319 infected patients, 76 fatal cases, and 1,144,648 individuals of the general public in China. Our results show a relatively low incidence risk for young people but a very high mortality risk for seniors. Notably, mortality risk could be as high as 0.48 for people older than 80 years. Furthermore, our study suggests that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1% or less.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Pre-Procedural Antibody Testing for SARS-CoV-2 in routine endoscopic practice.,"Retrospective multicentre cohort study of all endoscopic procedures performed between 4/27 and 6/15-2020.

Ocular Manifestations of Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Comprehensive Review,"Apart from conjunctival involvement which is the most well-known ocular manifestation of coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), there are multiple reports of the involvement of other ocular structures by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We comprehensively reviewed PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar for available evidence regarding COVID-19 various ocular manifestations, with special focus on less known and unusual ocular findings. We then categorized the findings based on the parts of the eye which was involved. In anterior sections of the eye, the involvement of the eyelid (tarsadenitis), conjunctiva and cornea (follicular conjunctivitis, pseudomembranous conjunctivitis, and keratoconjunctivitis), episclera (nodular episcleritis), uvea (anterior uveitis) were reported. Also, third, fourth, and sixth nerve palsy, retinal vasculitis, retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) changes (hyper-reflective lesions and increased retinal nerve fiber layer thickness [RNFLT]), optic neuritis, papillophlebitis, Miller Fisher syndrome, posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy (PRES), ophthalmic artery and central retinal artery occlusion, and polyneuritis cranialis were reported in different studies. Postmortem evaluation of COVID-19 patients detected no viral RNA in different anterior and posterior segments of the eyes. However, another study revealed a 21.4% positivity of the retinal biopsies of dead patients. The results of this study can help ophthalmologists to be vigilant when they see these findings in a suspected case of COVID-19. In addition, wearing face masks and protective goggles or eye shields are recommended, especially in high risk contacts.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Nutrition, the digestive system and immunity in COVID-19 infection","The current review aimed to synthesize the literature on the complex relationship between food consumption and nutritional status as well as the digestive system in order to examine the relationship between immunity and potential responses to COVID-19 infection. The goal is to help inform the many healthcare professionals working with COVID-19 patients. A literature search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE databases. Hand searches were also undertaken using Google and reference lists to identify recent evidence. Studies were critically appraised, and the findings were analyzed by narrative synthesis. Nutritional status can impact immunity in several ways, including affecting susceptibility to infection, severity of disease, and recovery time, and is therefore a significant consideration in the management of COVID-19. COVID-19 can also impact digestive function, which can further impact nutritional status. The role of Vitamin D deficiency in vulnerability to severe respiratory infections, including COVID-19, has been recognized, and it may have a role in treatment where deficiency is indicated. Healthcare professionals should be aware that obesity may be accompanied by micronutrient malnutrition including vitamin D deficiency and alterations in the microbiome and inflammatory responses, which can further impact immunity and disease severity. Multidisciplinary team-work is recommended in the management of patients with COVID-19, and approaches should include a consideration of nutritional status (both macronutrients and micronutrients), body weight, and gastrointestinal signs and symptom.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Vancomycin resistant Enterococci and its associated factors among HIV infected patients on anti-retroviral therapy in Ethiopia,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of vancomycin resistant Enterococci (VRE) has alarmed the global community due to its tendency for colonization of the gastrointestinal tract. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) patients are colonized by vancomycin resistant Enterococci than other groups. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of vancomycin resistant Enterococci and its associated factors among HIV infected patients on Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART). METHODS: Institution based cross sectional study was conducted among HIV infected patients on ART at from June 1 to August 30, 2020. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected by pre-tested structured questionnaire. Stool sample was collected and processed by standard microbiological techniques. Kirby Bauer Disc diffusion method was used to perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Data were entered by Epi data version 4.6.0.2 and analyzed by SPSS version 25. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression model was used to analyze the association between dependent and independent variables. P-values in the multivariable analysis, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to determine the strength of association. P-value &#8804;0.05 was considered as significant. RESULTS: Enterococci spp was isolated on 123/200 (61.50%) patients. Among these isolates, the incidence of vancomycin resistant Enterococci was 11.4% [95% CI: (6.0-17.0)]. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns against Enterococci showed highest rate of resistance to ampicillin (69.9%). Multidrug resistances were observed in 49.59% of Enterococci isolates. Study participants who had prior antibioticexposurer more than two weeks [AOR = 7.35; 95% CI: (1.2144.64)] and hospitalization for the last six months [AOR = 5.68; 95% CI: (1.09 29.74)] were significantly associated with vancomycin resistant Enterococci. CONCLUSIONS: In our study high incidence of vancomycin resistant Enterococci was found. Previous exposure to antibiotics for more than two weeks and hospitalization for more than six months were significantly associated with vancomycin resistant Enterococci. The isolated Enterococci had variable degrees of resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics. Therefore, periodic surveillance on antimicrobial resistance pattern, adhering to rational use of antibiotics and implementing infection prevention protocols may reduce colonization by VRE.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Siglec Ligands,"A dense and diverse array of glycans on glycoproteins and glycolipids decorate all cell surfaces. In vertebrates, many of these carry sialic acid, in a variety of linkages and glycan contexts, as their outermost sugar moiety. Among their functions, glycans engage complementary glycan binding proteins (lectins) to regulate cell physiology. Among the glycan binding proteins are the Siglecs, sialic acid binding immunoglobulin-like lectins. In humans, there are 14 Siglecs, most of which are expressed on overlapping subsets of immune system cells. Each Siglec engages distinct, endogenous sialylated glycans that initiate signaling programs and regulate cellular responses. Here, we explore the emerging science of Siglec ligands, including endogenous sialoglycoproteins and glycolipids and synthetic sialomimetics. Knowledge in this field promises to reveal new molecular pathways controlling cell physiology and new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Sleeping Beauties of Coronavirus Research,"A ""Sleeping Beauty"" (SB) in science is a metaphor for a scholarly publication that remains relatively unnoticed by the related communities for a long time;- the publication is ""sleeping"" However, suddenly due to the appearance of some phenomenon, such a ""forgotten"" publication may become a center of scientific attention;- the SB is ""awakened"" Currently, there are specific scientific areas for which sleeping beauties (SBs) are awakened For example, as the world is experiencing the COVID-19 global pandemic (triggered by SARS-CoV-2), publications on coronaviruses appear to be awakened Thus, one can raise questions of scientific interest: are these publications coronavirus related SBs? Moreover, while much literature exists on other coronaviruses, there seems to be no comprehensive investigation on COVID-19, - in particular in the context of SBs Nowadays, such SB papers can be even used for sustaining literature reviews and/or scientific claims about COVID-19 In our study, in order to pinpoint pertinent SBs, we use the ""beauty score"" (B-score) measure The Activity Index (AI) and the Relative Specialization Index (RSI) are also calculated to compare countries where such SBs appear Results show that most of these SBs were published previously to the present epidemic time (triggered by SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1), and are awakened in 2020 Besides outlining the most important SBs, we show from what countries and institutions they originate, and the most prolific author(s) of such SBs The citation trend of SBs that have the highest B-score is also discussed",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
COVID-19 and Black Fungus: Analysis of the Public Perception through Machine Learning,"While COVID-19 is ravaging the lives of millions of people across the globe, a second pandemic 'black fungus' has surfaced robbing people of their lives especially people who are recovering from coronavirus. Again, the public perceptions regarding such pandemics can be investigated through sentiment analysis of social media data. Thus the objective of this study is to analyze public perceptions through sentiment analysis regarding black fungus during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. To attain the objective, first, a Support Vector Machine model, with an average AUC of 82.75%, was developed to classify user sentiments in terms of anger, fear, joy, and sad. Next, this Support Vector Machine is used to supervise the class labels of the public tweets (n = 6477) related to COVID-19 and black fungus. As outcome, this study found that public perceptions belong to sad (n = 2370, 36.59 %), followed by joy ( n = 2095, 32.34%), fear ( n = 1914, 29.55 %) and anger ( n = 98, 1.51%) towards black fungus during COVID-19 pandemic. This study also investigated public perceptions of some critical concerns (e.g., education, lockdown, hospital, oxygen, quarantine, and vaccine) and it was found that public perceptions of these issues varied. For example, for the most part, people exhibited fear in social media about education, hospital, vaccine while some people expressed joy about education, hospital, vaccine, and oxygen.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Protective Immunity against SARS Subunit Vaccine Candidates Based on Spike Protein: Lessons for Coronavirus Vaccine Development,"The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has highlighted the threat that highly pathogenic coronaviruses have on global health security and the imminent need to design an effective vaccine for prevention purposes. Although several attempts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus infections since the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, there is no available licensed vaccine yet. A better understanding of previous coronavirus vaccine studies may help to design a vaccine for the newly emerged virus, SARS-CoV-2, that may also cover other pathogenic coronaviruses as a potentially universal vaccine. In general, coronavirus spike protein is the major antigen for the vaccine design as it can induce neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity. By considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, here, protective immunity against SARS-CoV spike subunit vaccine candidates in animal models has been reviewed to gain advances that can facilitate coronavirus vaccine development in the near future.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Research into psychiatry trainees views around the impact COVID-19 has had on the provision of electroconvulsive therapy training,"Aims The current COVID-19 outbreak has changed the way electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is provided. In many areas it has been moved from the more traditional ECT suites to general surgical theatres for a number of reasons, most notably being the need to ensure adequate ventilation. The introduction of the need for PPE to be worn throughout ECT and for general hospital operating procedures to be adhered to has also been a big change. The change in the required infection control procedures has had an impact on treatment capacity and has led many areas to reduce, relocate or centralise their ECT provisions which has had a knock on effect on training. This study assesses the perceived impact COVID-19 has had on the provision of training and learning in ECT for core and higher psychiatry trainees in the North West as well as their perceived competence levels. Method Views were sought through surveys and focus groups from September to December 2020, participants were core and higher psychiatry trainees in the North West. Participants were recruited via email, the total population size was 87, 21 Core trainees responded and 14 higher trainees. From the survey respondents, 5 participants agreed to attend a focus group. Result Results show that the provision of ECT training has been poor during the COVID-19 outbreak. Almost 81% of core trainees surveyed and 92.86% of higher trainees had participated in no ECT sessions from the start of the COVID-19 outbreak to the time of data collection eight to ten months later. 81% of core trainees and 85.71% of higher trainees had received no teaching in any form about ECT over the period studied. When considering the competencies required in ECT for a core trainee, one (4.76%) felt they were fully competent, 3 (14.29%) nearly competent, 7(33.33%) needs some improvement, 10 (47.62%) not yet competent. Only one higher trainee felt they met the RCPsych competencies, 5 (35.71%) were nearly competent, 6 (42.86%) need some improvement and 2 (14.29%) were not yet competent. Conclusion This study indicates a clear lack of provision of training which is very concerning ,and possibly pre dates the COVID outbreak, particularly in the case of specialty trainees who may well be consultants in a number of months and will not have the time to make up for the lost training. In order for ECT provision to continue it is crucial that we are able to adequately train the future workforce.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Shining light on transition metal sulfides: New choices as highly efficient antibacterial agents,"Globally, millions of people die of microbial infection-related diseases every year. The more terrible situation is that due to the overuse of antibiotics, especially in developing countries, people are struggling to fight with the bacteria variation. The emergence of super-bacteria will be an intractable environmental and health hazard in the future unless novel bactericidal weapons are mounted. Consequently, it is critical to develop viable antibacterial approaches to sustain the prosperous development of human society. Recent researches indicate that transition metal sulfides (TMSs) represent prominent bactericidal application potential owing to the meritorious antibacterial performance, acceptable biocompatibility, high solar energy utilization efficiency, and excellent photo-to-thermal conversion characteristics, and thus, a comprehensive review on the recent advances in this area would be beneficial for the future development. In this review article, we start with the antibacterial mechanisms of TMSs to provide a preliminary understanding. Thereafter, the state-of-the-art research progresses on the strategies for TMSs materials engineering so as to promote their antibacterial properties are systematically surveyed and summarized, followed by a summary of the practical application scenarios of TMSs-based antibacterial platforms. Finally, based on the thorough survey and analysis, we emphasize the challenges and future development trends in this area. [Image: see text]",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Exercising autonomy-the effectiveness and meaningfulness of autonomy support interventions engaged by adults with intellectual disability.

Subsequently, evolving models for supported decision-making and informed consent present guidance to enable autonomy support, which have relevance to people with intellectual disabilities. To date, reviews have explored how adults with intellectual disabilities exercise their autonomy or factors impacting the development of their self-determination. This review aimed to establish the effectiveness of 'autonomy support interventions' engaged by adults with intellectual disability and the meaning of these interventions to this cohort. Methods A systematic search of Cinahl Complete, PsychINFO and Scopus databases was undertaken. The search was limited to studies published between 2000 and 2020. Identified citations were uploaded to EndNote X9, duplicates removed, search outputs imported into Covidence and titles and s screened. Data were extracted using an amended JBI data extraction Tool. The search strategy is reported in the adapted PRISMA flow diagram. Findings Twelve studies were included in the mixed methods review. Critical appraisal was undertaken using the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool. These findings identified varied and creative autonomy support interventions utilised across ordinary activities with adults with intellectual disabilities. Conclusion This review identifies the essential components of how autonomy support interventions can enhance ordinary experiences for adults with intellectual disabilities while enabling them to develop skill sets to be more self-directed in the choices they make.

The notion of Kapwa amid Asian hate,"In a letter to the editor, the author has expressed how a Chinese notion of ren is a powerful tool to negate the stigma of racial discrimination among Asian people. I would argue that within the Filipino psyche, the notion of kapwa or “shared self” can be an equivalent socio-normative ideal that can be utilized towards not just countering the ill effects of social discrimination but also fostering deep communal and group solidarity among people, regardless of race, color and ethnicity.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Medical device legislation for custom-made devices after the UK has left the EU: answers to ten important questions,"The 1990s saw the introduction of three European directives that aimed to harmonise medical device legislation within the European Union (EU), which were given effect in the UK by The Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (Statutory Instrument 2002/618). Dental professionals who prescribe and manufacture custom-made devices were required to do so in accordance with the relevant requirements of one of these directives, Council Directive 93/42/EEC (Medical Device Directive [MDD]). The MDD has been replaced by Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (Medical Device Regulation [EU MDR]) and this paper answers some important questions regarding the ways in which this affects the provision of custom-made devices in a dental setting.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Real-time quantification of the transmission advantage associated with a single mutation in pathogen genomes: a case study on the D614G substitution of SARS-CoV-2,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic poses serious threats to global health, and the emerging mutation in SARS-CoV-2 genomes, e.g., the D614G substitution, is one of the major challenges of disease control. Characterizing the role of the mutation activities is of importance to understand how the evolution of pathogen shapes the epidemiological outcomes at population scale. METHODS: We developed a statistical framework to reconstruct variant-specific reproduction numbers and estimate transmission advantage associated with the mutation activities marked by single substitution empirically. Using likelihood-based approach, the model is exemplified with the COVID-19 surveillance data from January 1 to June 30, 2020 in California, USA. We explore the potential of this framework to generate early warning signals for detecting transmission advantage on a real-time basis. RESULTS: The modelling framework in this study links together the mutation activity at molecular scale and COVID-19 transmissibility at population scale. We find a significant transmission advantage of COVID-19 associated with the D614G substitution, which increases the infectivity by 54% (95%CI: 36, 72). For the early alarming potentials, the analytical framework is demonstrated to detect this transmission advantage, before the mutation reaches dominance, on a real-time basis. CONCLUSIONS: We reported an evidence of transmission advantage associated with D614G substitution, and highlighted the real-time estimating potentials of modelling framework.

[Epidemiological study design of asymptomatic infection of the 2019 novel coronavirus].,"COVID-19 is caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). COVID-19clinical cases are considered as the principal source of infection, however, asymptomatic cases may also play a role in the transmission. Significant gap exists in terms of the proportion or prevalence and transmissibility of asymptomatic cases. This study design plans to use data from areas with different epidemiological profiles to investigate theCOVID-19 epidemic in China. In each selected region, both general community residents and key populations at high risk of COVID-19 infection, including recovered COVID-19 cases, close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases, medical professionals, investigators at CDCs, and visitors to fever clinics, will be recruited and examined for viral RNA of 2019-nCoV and serum antibodies. Prevalence and characterization of asymptomatic cases will be determined, stratified by varied demographics and exposure risk. During the follow-up, the change in the serum antibodies will be studied prospectively in the symptomatic and asymptomatic cases to address the scientific and public health concerns of infectivity and transmissibility of 2019-nCoV.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Network pharmacology integrated molecular docking reveals the bioactive components and potential targets of Morinda officinalis–Lycium barbarum coupled-herbs against oligoasthenozoospermia,"Oligoasthenozoospermia (OA) is one of the most common types of male infertility affecting sperm count and sperm motility. Unfortunately, it is difficult for existing drugs to fundamentally improve the sperm quality of OA patients, because the pathological mechanism of OA has not been fully elucidated yet. Morinda officinalis–Lycium barbarum coupled-herbs (MOLBCH), as traditional Chinese Medicines, has been widely used for treating OA over thousands of years, but its molecular mechanism is still unclear. For this purpose, we adopted a comprehensive approach integrated network pharmacology and molecular docking to reveal the bioactive components and potential targets of MOLBCH against OA. The results showed that MOLBCH alleviated apoptosis, promoted male reproductive function, and reduced oxidant stress in the treatment of OA. Ohioensin-A, quercetin, beta-sitosterol and sitosterol were the key bioactive components. Androgen receptor (AR), Estrogen receptor (ESR1), Mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3), RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT1), Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were the core potential targets. PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, prostate cancer, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications were the most representative pathways. Moreover, molecular docking was performed to validate the strong binding interactions between the obtained core components and targets. These observations provide deeper insight into the pathogenesis of OA and can be used to design new drugs and develop new therapeutic instructions to treat OA.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Dealing with Emotional Vulnerability and Anxiety in Nurses from High-Risk Units—A Multicenter Study,"Compassion fatigue and anxiety derived from continued exposure to trauma and death greatly impact nurses’ quality of care and quality of life, increasing their desire to leave work. The aim of the study is to assess compassion fatigue and anxiety prevalence and their association with secondary variables. A multicenter, cross-sectional study in nurses from four high-risk units, Emergency, Intensive Care, Oncology, and Pediatrics, was carried out in 14 hospitals in Catalonia (Spain) between 2015 and 2016. The primary endpoints were compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue (burnout and secondary traumatic stress), which were assessed by Professional Quality of Life (ProQOL), and anxiety, assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Multivariable logistic regression analyzed the association of sociodemographic, training, working, and psychological factors. Of a total of 1302 nurses, 18.6% presented low compassion satisfaction; 19.7%, high burnout; and 36.4%, high secondary traumatic stress. Trait anxiety scored high in 7.2%. Although compassion satisfaction was present, it did not protect sufficiently against the high level of compassion fatigue or anxiety present in nurses in all centers. The working conditions in the units and variables showed a strong association with nurses’ desire to leave. This corroborates the global challenge of healthcare professionals’ shortage. Participants expressed the need for better training in emotional management.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with Inanimate Surfaces in Built and Transportation Environments,"Understanding the interactions and transmission of pathogens with/via inanimate surfaces common in the built environment and public transport vehicles is critical to promoting sustainable and resilient urban development. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to study the adhesion of SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of COVID-19) to some of these surfaces at different temperatures (same for surfaces and ambiance) ranging from -23 to 60 °C. Surfaces simulated are aluminum, copper, copper oxide, polyethylene (PE), and silicon dioxide (SiO2). Steered MD (SMD) simulations are also used to investigate the transfer of the virus from PE and SiO2 when a contaminated surface is touched. The virus shows the lowest and highest adhesions to PE and SiO2, respectively (20 vs 534 eV). Influence of temperature is not found to be noticeable. Using simulated water molecules to represent moisture on the skin, SMD simulations show that water molecules can lift the virus from the PE surface but damage the virus when lifting it from the the SiO2 surface. The results suggest that the PE surface is a more favorable surface to transmit the virus than the other surfaces simulated in this study. The results are compared with those reported in a few experimental studies.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Adolescents' media usage and self-reported exposure to advertising across six countries: implications for less healthy food and beverage marketing.,"OBJECTIVES The study objectives were to examine: (1) adolescents' media viewing habits, (2) associations with media viewing and self-reported exposure to unhealthy food and beverage advertising and (3) differences in trends among younger and older adolescents in six high and upper middle-income countries. DESIGN Repeat cross-sectional online survey. SETTING Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA). PARTICIPANTS Respondents to the International Food Policy Study who provided information on all variables of interest in November-December 2019 aged 10-17 years (n=9171). OUTCOME MEASURES Self-reported exposure to screen-based media (screen time by media channel), use of social media platforms and self-reported location and frequency of exposure to unhealthy food and beverage advertising. RESULTS The average amount of time spent in front of various screens ranged from 7.6 hours to 10.2 hours across countries per week day, which may include possible viewing of multiple media channels simultaneously. Overall, Instagram was the most popular social media platform (52%-68% by country), followed by Facebook (42%-79%) and Snapchat (28%-52%). The percentage of respondents who self-reported having seen unhealthy food advertisements in the past 30 days was highest on television (43%-69%), followed by digital media (27%-60%) and gaming applications (10%-17%). Self-reported daily exposure to advertising varied between countries for sugary drinks (10%-43%) and fast food (19%-44%) and was positively associated with self-reported screen time. Self-reported exposure to screen-based media and social media platforms differed by sociodemographic characteristics and was higher among older adolescents than younger adolescents. CONCLUSIONS The important amount of time spent on screen-based media reported by adolescents and large percentage of adolescents reporting social media usage, coupled with high rates of self-reported advertising exposure, support the need for policies to restrict marketing of unhealthy food and beverages appealing to adolescents on screen-based media.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Saliva-based detection of COVID-19 infection in a real-world setting using reagent-free Raman spectroscopy and machine learning,"SignificanceThe primary method of COVID-19 detection is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. PCR test sensitivity may decrease as more variants of concern arise. AimWe aimed to develop a reagent-free way to detect COVID-19 in a real-world setting with minimal constraints on sample acquisition. ApproachWe present a workflow for collecting, preparing and imaging dried saliva supernatant droplets using a non-invasive, label-free technique - Raman spectroscopy - to detect changes in the molecular profile of saliva associated with COVID-19 infection. ResultsUsing machine learning and droplet segmentation, amongst all confounding factors, we discriminated between COVID-positive and negative individuals yielding receiver operating coefficient (ROC) curves with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.8 in both males (79% sensitivity, 75% specificity) and females (84% sensitivity, 64% specificity). Taking the sex of the saliva donor into account increased the AUC by 5%.

Effect of the SARS-CoV2 pandemic on endoscopy provision - The Impact of Compliance with National Guidance.,"Objective There is limited data on the impact of the pandemic upon endoscopy service provision and quality indicators. Methods Analysis of number and type of procedure, in-room time (minutes), key performance indicators and list utilisation was performed over 3 periods; pre-lockdown, lockdown and early recovery and compared with the previous year. Results Endoscopy activity reduced to 13.3% of the same period in 2019 with the largest drops in colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy numbers. In-room time increased significantly for gastroscopy (35 vs. 24, p<0.0001), flexible sigmoidoscopy (20 vs. 15, p<0.0001), endoscopic ultrasound (40 vs. 32, p=0.0009) and ERCP (59 vs. 45, p=0.0041). There was no increase for colonoscopy (35 vs 35, p=0.129). There was a significant reduction for in-room time for gastroscopy alone (44.5 vs. 30.0, p=0.0002) over the study period. There was no significant difference in caecal intubation rate, polyp detection rate or biliary cannulation rate compared to the previous year. Conclusions The pandemic has profoundly reduced the number of endoscopies performed with some recovery. In-room time has significantly increased but with preservation of key performance indicators. List utilisation remains a significant problem and resources need to be adequately aligned to improve this.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Organizational Support Experiences of Care Home and Home Care Staff in Sweden, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected care workers all over the globe, as older and more vulnerable people face a high risk of developing severe symptoms and dying from the virus infection. The aim of this study was to compare staff experiences of stress and anxiety as well as internal and external organizational support in Sweden, Italy, Germany, and the United Kingdom (UK) in order to determine how care staff were affected by the pandemic. A 29-item online questionnaire was used to collect data from care staff respondents: management (n = 136), nurses (n = 132), nursing assistants (n = 195), and other healthcare staff working in these organizations (n = 132). Stress and anxiety levels were highest in the UK and Germany, with Swedish staff showing the least stress. Internal and external support only partially explain the outcomes. Striking discrepancies between different staff groups’ assessment of organizational support as well as a lack of staff voice in the UK and Germany could be key factors in understanding staff’s stress levels during the pandemic. Structural, political, cultural, and economic factors play a significant role, not only factors within the care organization or in the immediate context.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with severe acquired brain injury and a disorder of consciousness: an observational study.,"Purpose: SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause the coronavirus disease (COVID), ranging from flu-like symptoms to interstitial pneumonia. Mortality is high in COVID pneumonia and it is the highest among the frailest. COVID could be particularly serious in patients with severe acquired brain injury (SABI), such as those with a disorder of consciousness. We here describe a cohort of patients with a disorder of consciousness exposed to SARS-CoV-2 early after their SABI. Materials and methods: The full cohort of 11 patients with SABI hospitalized in March 2020 in the IRCCS Fondazione Don Gnocchi rehabilitation (Milan, Italy) was recruited. Participants received SARS-CoV-2 testing and different clinical and laboratory data were collected. Results: Six patients contracted SARS-CoV-2 and four of them developed the COVID. Of these, one patient had ground-glass opacities on the chest CT scan, while the remaining three developed consolidations. No patient died and the overall respiratory involvement was mild, requiring in the worst cases low-flow oxygen. Conclusions: Here we report the clinical course of a cohort of patients with SABI exposed to SARS-CoV-2. The infection spread among patients and caused COVID in some of them. Unexpectedly, COVID was moderate, caused at most mild respiratory distress and did not result in fatalities.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Racism and health care: Experiences of latinx immigrant women in NYC during COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected minoritized racial groups, especially Latinx immigrants, evidenced by the high rates of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths among this population. With increasing xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment in parallel to the pandemic, it is critical to understand the perspectives of Latinx populations. This study explores Latinx immigrant women's perceptions of racism and xenophobia in their health care experiences in New York City (NYC) during the COVID-19 pandemic and, further, seeks to understand the role of perceived discrimination in health care settings and on health care access. Data were analyzed using a constant comparative method of analysis from twenty-one in-depth interviews conducted with foreign-born women in the five boroughs of New York City from diverse countries across Latin America. Four central themes emerged including: structural inequalities, discriminatory health care experiences, victimization in public institutions, and overcoming discrimination in health care settings. Latinx immigrant women described the ways in which perceptions and experiences of discrimination shaped their capacity to address health-related needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study provides evidence to a growing body of literature suggesting that structural racism and xenophobia and perceptions of anti-immigrant discrimination, including resulting structural inequalities, may have a negative effect on individuals' ability to access and engage the health care system, resulting in avoidance of health care services – a critical need during a global pandemic. Scholars, policymakers, and practitioners alike should be mindful of how racism and xenophobia shape Latinx immigrant communities' engagement with the health care system.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Health Literacy, Digital Health Literacy, and COVID-19 Pandemic Attitudes and Behaviors in U.S. College Students: Implications for Interventions","The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by rapidly emerging evidence, changing guidance, and misinformation, which present new challenges for health literacy (HL) and digital health literacy (DHL) skills. This study explored whether COVID-19-related information access, attitudes, and behaviors were associated with health literacy and digital health literacy among college students in the United States. Self-reported measures of health literacy, along with items on pandemic-related attitudes, behaviors, information sources, and social networks, were collected online using a managed research panel. In July 2020, 256 responses were collected, which mirrored the racial/ethnic and gender diversity of U.S. colleges. Only 49% reported adequate HL, and 57% found DHL tasks easy overall. DHL did not vary by HL level. In multivariable models, both HL and DHL were independently associated with overall compliance with basic preventive practices. Higher DHL, but not HL, was significantly associated with greater willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine and the belief that acquiring the disease would negatively impact their life. On average, respondents discussed health with 4-5 people, which did not vary by HL or DHL measures. The usage of online information sources varied by HL and DHL. The study findings can inform future student-focused interventions, including identifying the distinct roles of HL and DHL in pandemic information access, attitudes, and behaviors.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

This study presents machine-learning models for the prediction and visualization of the significant factors that determine the survivability of COVID-19 patients. This study develops prediction models using a decision tree, logistic regression (LR), gradient boosting, and LR algorithms to identify the significant factors and predict the survivability of COVID-19 patients. The results of the simulation showed that the LR model had the lowest prediction accuracy. The other three showed over 95% correct accuracy and indicated that the essential factors in determining patients' survivability were underlying health conditions and age. The findings of this study agreed with the medical claims that patients with underlying health challenges and those advanced in age are liable to have complications; hence, providing a research-based credence to this belief. This proposed model thus serves as a decision support system for the management of COVID-19 patients, as well as predicts a patient’s chances of survival at the first presentation at the hospitals.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
The Impact of Early-Life Exposures on Women’s Reproductive Health in Adulthood,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the effects of early-life, preconception, and prior-generation exposures on reproductive health in women. RECENT FINDINGS: Women’s early-life factors can affect reproductive health by contributing to health status or exposure level on entering pregnancy. Alternately, they can have permanent effects, regardless of later-life experience. Nutrition, social class, parental smoking, other adverse childhood experiences, environmental pollutants, infectious agents, and racism and discrimination all affect reproductive health, even if experienced in childhood or in utero. Possible transgenerational effects are now being investigated through three- or more-generation studies. These effects occur with mechanisms that may include direct exposure, behavioral, endocrine, inflammatory, and epigenetic pathways. SUMMARY: Pregnancy is increasingly understood in a life course perspective, but rigorously testing hypotheses on early-life effects is still difficult. In order to improve the health outcomes of all women, we need to expand our toolkit of methods and theory. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40471-021-00279-0.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) in COVID-19,"Objective: The purpose of this article is to describe BPPV in COVID-19 patients by discussing the possible mechanisms underlying the onset of this vertigo. Methods: We studied eight patients (4 F, 4 M, aged between 44 and 69 years) with COVID-19 infections complaining of vertigo. Patients were evaluated at the end of infection with an accurate clinical history, and the investigation of spontaneous, positional and positioning nystagmus. Results: The vestibular findings showed benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in all the patients. Three patients had a mild phenotype of the COVID infection, whereas five subjects were hospitalized for the COVID infection and in three cases intensive care was required. Vestibular evaluation showed an involvement of posterior semicircular canals in five patients and horizontal in three. Three patients were treated with the Epley maneuver, two with Semont, one with Lempert and two with Gufoni maneuvers. Conclusions: We hypothesize that BPPV in COVID-19 infections can be relate to drugs, prolonged bed rest and to direct damage by viral infection on the peripheral vestibular system and in particular on the otolitic membrane due to the cytopathic effect of the virus and to the inflammatory response. Studies on large series of patients are needed to confirm our preliminary observation and to better evaluate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying BPPV in these patients.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
CrossSum: Beyond English-Centric Cross-Lingual Abstractive Text Summarization for 1500+ Language Pairs,"We present CrossSum, a large-scale cross-lingual abstractive summarization dataset comprising 1.7 million article-summary samples in 1500+ language pairs. We create CrossSum by aligning identical articles written in different languages via cross-lingual retrieval from a multilingual summarization dataset. We propose a multi-stage data sampling algorithm to effectively train a cross-lingual summarization model capable of summarizing an article in any target language. We also propose LaSE, a new metric for automatically evaluating model-generated summaries and showing a strong correlation with ROUGE. Performance on ROUGE and LaSE indicate that pretrained models fine-tuned on CrossSum consistently outperform baseline models, even when the source and target language pairs are linguistically distant. To the best of our knowledge, CrossSum is the largest cross-lingual summarization dataset and the first-ever that does not rely solely on English as the pivot language. We are releasing the dataset, alignment and training scripts, and the models to spur future research on cross-lingual abstractive summarization.

Barriers and facilitators to resuming meaningful daily activities among critical illness survivors in the UK: a qualitative content analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To identify critical illness survivors’ perceived barriers and facilitators to resuming performance of meaningful activities when transitioning from hospital to home. DESIGN: Secondary content analysis of semistructured interviews about patients’ experiences of intensive care (primary analysis disseminated on the patient-facing website www.healthtalk.org). Two coders characterised patient-perceived barriers and facilitators to resuming meaningful activities. To facilitate clinical application, we mapped the codes onto the Person-Task-Environment model of performance, a patient-centred rehabilitation model that characterises complex interactions among the person, task and environment when performing activities. SETTING: United Kingdom, 2005–2006. PARTICIPANTS: 39 adult critical illness survivors, sampled for variation among demographics and illness experiences. RESULTS: Person-related barriers included negative mood or affect, perceived setbacks; weakness or limited endurance; pain or discomfort; inadequate nutrition or hydration; poor concentration/confusion; disordered sleep/hallucinations/nightmares; mistrust of people or information; and altered appearance. Task-related barriers included miscommunication and managing conflicting priorities. Environment-related barriers included non-supportive health services and policies; challenging social attitudes; incompatible patient–family coping (emotional trauma and physical disability); equipment problems; overstimulation; understimulation; and environmental inaccessibility. Person-related facilitators included motivation or attitude; experiencing progress; and religion or spirituality. Task-related facilitators included communication. Environment-related facilitators included support from family, friends or healthcare providers; supportive health services and policies; equipment; community resources; medications; and accessible housing. Barriers decreased and facilitators increased over time. Six barrier–facilitator domains dominated based on frequency and emphasis across all performance goals: mood/motivation, setbacks/progress, fatiguability/strength; mis/communication; lack/community support; lack/health services and policies. CONCLUSIONS: Critical illness survivors described a comprehensive inventory of 18 barriers and 11 facilitators that align with the Person-Task-Environment model of performance. Six dominant barrier–facilitator domains seem strong targets for impactful interventions. These results verify previous knowledge and offer novel opportunities for optimising patient-centred care and reducing disability after critical illness.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
In-vivo evidence of systemic endothelial vascular dysfunction in COVID-19,"BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction is one of the underlying mechanisms to vascular and cardiac complications in patients with COVID-19. We sought to investigate the systemic vascular endothelial function and its temporal changes in COVID-19 patients from a non-invasive approach with reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT). METHODS: This is a prospective, observational, case-control and blinded study. The population was comprised by 3 groups: patients investigated during acute COVID-19 (group 1), patients investigated during past COVID-19 (group 2), and controls 1:1 matched to COVID-19 patients by demographics and cardiovascular risk factors (group 3). The natural logarithmic scaled reactive hyperemia index (LnRHI), a measure of endothelium-mediated dilation of peripheral arteries, was obtained in all the participants and compared between study groups. RESULTS: 144 participants were enrolled (72 COVID-19 patients and 72 matched controls). Median time from COVID-19 symptoms to PAT assessment was 9.5 and 101.5 days in groups 1 and 2, respectively. LnRHI was significantly lower in group 2 compared to both group 1 and controls (0.53 ± 0.23 group 2 vs. 0.72 ± 0.26 group 1, p = 0.0043; and 0.79 ± 0.23 in group 3, p < 0.0001). In addition, within group 1, it was observed a markedly decrease in LnRHI from acute COVID-19 to post infection stage (0.73 ± 0.23 vs. 0.42 ± 0.26, p = 0.0042). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a deleterious effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on systemic vascular endothelial function. These findings open new venues to investigate the clinical implication and prognostic role of vascular endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 patients and post-COVID syndrome using non-invasive techniques.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Prime-boost vaccination of mice and rhesus macaques with two novel adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccine candidates,"ABSTRACTCOVID-19 vaccines are being developed urgently worldwide. Here, we constructed two adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccine candidates of Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S carrying the full-length gene of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The immunogenicity of two vaccines was individually evaluated in mice. Specific immune responses were observed by priming in a dose-dependent manner, and stronger responses were obtained by boosting. Furthermore, five rhesus macaques were primed with 5 × 109 PFU Sad23L-nCoV-S, followed by boosting with 5 × 109 PFU Ad49L-nCoV-S at 4-week interval. Both mice and macaques well tolerated the vaccine inoculations without detectable clinical or pathologic changes. In macaques, prime-boost regimen induced high titers of 103.16 anti-S, 102.75 anti-RBD binding antibody and 102.38 pseudovirus neutralizing antibody (pNAb) at 2 months, while pNAb decreased gradually to 101.45 at 7 months post-priming. Robust T-cell response of IFN-Î³ (712.6 SFCs/106 cells), IL-2 (334 SFCs/106 cells) and intracellular IFN-Î³ in CD4+/CD8+ T cell (0.39%/0.55%) to S peptides were detected in vaccinated macaques. It was concluded that prime-boost immunization with Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S can safely elicit strong immunity in animals in preparation of clinical phase 1/2 trials.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

"Exploring the Impact of COVID-19 Response on Population Health in Saudi Arabia: Results from the ""Sharik"" Health Indicators Surveillance System during 2020","BACKGROUND: Although some studies have explored the effects of responses to COVID-19 on mortality, there are limited data on their effects on more immediate health risk factors and the trends of chronic diseases. OBJECTIVE: To explore the prevalence of some behavioral health risk factors, intermediate risk factors, and chronic diseases at different timepoints during 2020 using the data available from a currently used surveillance system in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This study undertook a secondary analysis of data from the Sharik Health Indicators Surveillance System (SHISS). The SHISS employs short cross-sectional phone interviews, conducted in all 13 administrative regions of Saudi Arabia on a quarterly basis. Each interview lasts approximately 4 min and is conducted by a trained data collector. The SHISS collects demographic data, as well as data on the major behavioral and intermediate chronic disease risk factors and the major chronic diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer, and chronic respiratory diseases. RESULTS: Of the 44,782 potential participants contacted in 2020, 30,134 completed the interview, with a response rate of 67.29%. Out of the total participants, 51.2% were female. The mean age was 36.5. The behavioral risk factors in this period exhibited significant changes compared to those in the first quarter (Q1) of 2020, when there were no significant restrictions on daily activities. These significant changes are related to reductions in fruit and vegetable intake (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 0.23) and physical activity (AOR, 0.483), and a significant increase in e-cigarette use (AOR 1.531). In terms of the intermediate risk factors observed in the SHISS, significant increases in hypercholesterolemia (AOR, 1.225) and hypertension (AOR, 1.190) were observed. Finally, heart disease (AOR, 1.279) and diabetes (AOR, 1.138) displayed significant increases compared to Q1. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows some evidence of the impact of responses to COVID-19 on the health of the population in Saudi Arabia. Significant reductions in fruit and vegetable intake and physical activity, and significant increases in e-cigarette use, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia may increase the burden of chronic diseases in Saudi Arabia in the near future. Thus, continuous monitoring of the health risk factors within the population, and early interventions, are recommended to prevent future increases in chronic diseases.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Short-Term Dexamethasone in Sars-CoV-2 Patients.,"BACKGROUND Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, has anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. There is a hyperinflammatory response involved in the clinical course of patients with pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2. To date, there has been no definite therapy for COVID-19. We reviewed the charts of SARS-CoV-2 patients with pneumonia and moderate to severely elevated CRP and worsening hypoxemia who were treated with early, short-term dexamethasone. METHODS We describe a series of 21 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were admitted to The Miriam Hospital in Providence, RI, and were treated with a short course of dexamethasone, either alone or in addition to current investigative therapies. RESULTS CRP levels decreased significantly following the start of dexamethasone from mean initial levels of 129.52 to 40.73 mg/L at time of discharge. 71% percent of the patients were discharged home with a mean length of stay of 7.8 days. None of the patients had escalation of care, leading to mechanical ventilation. Two patients were transferred to inpatient hospice facilities on account of persistent hypoxemia, in line with their documented goals of care. CONCLUSIONS A short course of systemic corticosteroids among inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 with hypoxic respiratory failure was well tolerated, and most patients had improved outcomes. This limited case series may not offer concrete evidence towards the benefit of corticosteroids in COVID-19. However, patients' positive response to short-term corticosteroids demonstrates that they may help blunt the severity of inflammation and prevent a severe hyperinflammatory phase, in turn reducing the length of stay, ICU admissions, and healthcare costs.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
An overview of some potential immunotherapeutic options against COVID-19,"After the advent of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) in the late 2019, the resulting severe and pernicious syndrome (COVID-19) immediately was deployed all around the world. To date, despite relentless efforts to control the disease by drug repurposing, there is no approved specific therapy for COVID-19. Given the role of innate and acquired immune components in the control and elimination of viral infections and inflammatory mutilations during SARS-CoV2 pathogenesis, immunotherapeutic strategies appear to be beneficent. Passive immunotherapies such as convalescent plasma, which has received much attention especially in severe cases, as well as suppressing inflammatory cytokines, interferon administration, inhibition of kinases and complement cascade, virus neutralization with key engineered products, cell-based therapies, immunomodulators and anti-inflammatory drugs are among the key immunotherapeutic approaches to deal with COVID-19, which is discussed in this review. Also, details of leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates as the most potent immunotherapy have been provided. However, despite salient improvements, there is still a lack of completely assured vaccines for universal application. Therefore, adopting proper immunotherapies according to the cytokine pattern and involved immune responses, alongside engineered biologics specially ACE2-Fc to curb SARS-CoV2 infection until achieving a tailored vaccine is probably the best strategy to better manage this pandemic. Therefore, gaining knowledge about the mechanism of action, potential targets, as well as the effectiveness of immune-based approaches to confront COVID-19 in the form of a well-ordered review study is highly momentous.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Epigenetic Biomarkers Screening of Non-Coding RNA and DNA Methylation Based on Peripheral Blood Monocytes in Smokers,"This study aims to use bioinformatics methods to determine the epigenetic changes in microRNA expression and DNA methylation caused by cigarette smoking. The data of mRNA, miRNA expression, and methylation microarray were obtained from the GEO database to filter differentially expressed genes (DEGs), differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs), and methylated CpG probes (DMPs) through the limma package. The R clusterProfile package was used for functional annotation and enrichment analysis. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed by the String database and visualized in Cytoscape software. Starbase database was employed to predict lncRNA and CirRNA based on the sequence of miRNA, and to establish a regulatory network of ceRNA. By overlapping DEG and DEM, 107 down-miRNA-targeted up-regulated genes and 65 up-miRNA-target down-regulated genes were obtained, which were mainly enriched in autophagy signaling pathways and protein ubiquitination pathways, respectively. In addition, 324 genes with low methylation and high expression and 204 genes with high methylation and low expression were respectively related to the degeneration of the nervous system and the function of the cardiovascular system. Interestingly, 43 genes were up-regulated under the dual regulation of reduced miRNA and hypomethylation, while 14 genes were down-regulated under the dual regulation of increased miRNA and hypermethylation. Ten chemicals have been identified as putative therapeutic agents for pathological conditions caused by smoking. In addition, among these genes, HSPA4, GRB2, PRKCA, and BCL2L1 could play a fundamental role in related diseases caused by smoking and may be used as the biomarkers for precise diagnosis and targets for future therapies of smoking-related diseases.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Caring for cancer patients during COVID-19 global pandemic: Risk factors and precautionary principle,"The current global pandemic COVID-19 challenges oncologists to reorganise cancer care in order to strikingly reduce hospital visits and admissions. Cancer patients are more susceptible to infections and likely to get severe consequences compared with other patients. Health-care facility services are quickly changing their systems and workflow in response to the global pandemic COVID-19 crisis. These alterations mitigate infection risks and give profound effects on crucial aspects of care, including patients with cancer. Here, we discuss the current situations and a roadmap for cancer care during the COVID-19 crisis. In the prevalence of global cancer and higher transmission of pandemic COVID-19, there is an urgent need to realise the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection and their related life-threatening outcomes specifically for cancer patients.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Critical Role of Simultaneous Reduction of Atmospheric Odd Oxygen for Winter Haze Mitigation,"The lockdown due to COVID-19 created a rare opportunity to examine the nonlinear responses of secondary aerosols, which are formed through atmospheric oxidation of gaseous precursors, to intensive precursor emission reductions. Based on unique observational data sets from six supersites in eastern China during 2019-2021, we found that the lockdown caused considerable decreases (32-61%) in different secondary aerosol components in the study region because of similar-degree precursor reductions. However, due to insufficient combustion-related volatile organic compound (VOC) reduction, odd oxygen (Ox = O3 + NO2) concentration, an indicator of the extent of photochemical processing, showed little change and did not promote more decreases in secondary aerosols. We also found that the Chinese provinces and international cities that experienced reduced Ox during the lockdown usually gained a greater simultaneous PM2.5 decrease than other provinces and cities with an increased Ox. Therefore, we argue that strict VOC control in winter, which has been largely ignored so far, is critical in future policies to mitigate winter haze more efficiently by reducing Ox simultaneously.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Spatial K-anonymity: A Privacy-preserving Method for COVID-19 Related Geospatial Technologies,"There is a growing need for spatial privacy considerations in the many geo-spatial technologies that have been created as solutions for COVID-19-related issues. Although effective geo-spatial technologies have already been rolled out, most have significantly sacrificed privacy for utility. In this paper, we explore spatial k-anonymity, a privacy-preserving method that can address this unnecessary tradeoff by providing the best of both privacy and utility. After evaluating its past implications in geo-spatial use cases, we propose applications of spatial k-anonymity in the data sharing and managing of COVID-19 contact tracing technologies as well as heat maps showing a user's travel history. We then justify our propositions by comparing spatial k-anonymity with several other spatial privacy methods, including differential privacy, geo-indistinguishability, and manual consent based redaction. Our hope is to raise awareness of the ever-growing risks associated with spatial privacy and how they can be solved with Spatial K-anonymity.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Giant cavity pulmonary lesion and pneumothorax simultaneously following COVID-19 pneumonia,"Cavitary lung formation with spontaneous pneumothorax has been rarely reported as a complication of COVID-19 pneumonia. We report a rare case of a 38 years-old male patient affected by COVID-19 pneumonia, exceptionally complicated by a simultaneous giant cavity in the right upper lung and a small right pneumothorax in the right hemithorax. Whilst pneumothorax emphysema, giant bullae and pneumothorax with alveolar rupture are known to potentially develop in COVID-19 patients as a result of high-flow O(2) support, the exact origin of the giant lung cavitation in our patient could be not confirmed. Cavitary lesions – featured by high mortality rate - are reportedly associated with lung infarctions and can be the aftermaths of pulmonary embolism, a rather common sequela of COVID-19 pneumonia. Radiological imaging is critical to support clinical decision making in the management of COVID-19 pneumonia, since not only it can visualize and stage the disease, but it can also detect and monitor the eventual onset of complications over time, even following patient discharge from hospital.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Inhibition of the OAS/RNase L pathway by viruses,"The OAS/RNase L system was one of the first characterized interferon effector pathways. It relies on the synthesis, by oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS), of short oligonucleotides that act as second messengers to activate the latent cellular RNase L. Viruses have developed diverse strategies to escape its antiviral effects. This underscores the importance of the OAS/RNase L pathway in antiviral defenses. Viral proteins such as the NS1 protein of Influenza virus A act upstream of the pathway while other viral proteins such as Theiler's virus L* protein act downstream. The diversity of escape strategies used by viruses likely stems from their relative susceptibility to OAS/RNase L and other antiviral pathways, which may depend on their host and cellular tropism.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Protection studies of an excretory–secretory protein HcABHD against Haemonchus contortus infection,"Unlike the successful immunization of native H. contortus antigens that contributed to the realization of the first commercial vaccine Barbervax, not many studies revealed the encouraging protective efficacies of recombinant H. contortus antigens in laboratory trials or under field conditions. In our preliminary study, H. contortus α/β-hydrolase domain protein (HcABHD) was demonstrated to be an immunomodulatory excretory–secretory (ES) protein that interacts with goat T cells. We herein evaluated the protective capacities of two HcABHD preparations, recombinant HcABHD (rHcABHD) antigen and anti-rHcABHD IgG, against H. contortus challenge via active and passive immunization trials, respectively. Parasitological parameter, antibody responses, hematological pathology and cytokine profiling in unchallenged and challenged goats were monitored and determined throughout both trials. Subcutaneous administration of rHcABHD with Freund adjuvants elicited protective immune responses in challenged goats, diminishing cumulative fecal egg counts (FEC) and total worm burden by 54.0% and 74.2%, respectively, whereas passive immunization with anti-rHcABHD IgG conferred substantial protection to challenged goats by generating a 51.5% reduction of cumulative FEC and a 73.8% reduction of total worm burden. Additionally, comparable changes of mucosal IgA levels, circulating IgG levels, hemoglobin levels, and serum interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-17A levels were observed in rHcABHD protein/anti-rHcABHD IgG immunized goats in both trials. Taken together, the recombinant version of HcABHD might have further application under field conditions in protecting goats against H. contortus infection, and the integrated immunological pipeline of ES antigen identification, screening and characterization may provide new clues for further development of recombinant subunit vaccines to control H. contortus.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
The impact of financial development and geopolitical risk on renewable energy consumption: evidence from emerging markets,"In the past three decades, the significance of large industrialized emerging economies has been highlighted. In terms of economic productivity and CO2 emissions, these markets play an important role in the global environment. Hence, to achieve global environmental needs, transition to renewable energy sources is essential. However, financial constraints along with geopolitical risks could act as possible barriers to the required transition. Thereby, in this paper, we aim to assess the impact of financial development and geopolitical risk on renewable energy consumption in emerging markets from 1996 to 2015. A two-step system GMM is tested, revealing a positive significant effect of financial development on transition to renewable energy. Moreover, contrary to the expected negative effect of geopolitical risk, our results reveal significant positive effect of geopolitical risk on renewable energy consumption. We highlight that the effects of both financial development and geopolitical risk are more pronounced in the long run. Finally, imperative policy implications are highlighted.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
New Consensus pattern in Spike CoV-2: potential implications in coagulation process and cell–cell fusion,"Coagulopathy and syncytial formation are relevant effects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the underlying molecular mechanisms triggering these processes are not fully elucidated. Here, we identified a potential consensus pattern in the Spike S glycoprotein present within the cytoplasmic domain; this consensus pattern was detected in only 79 out of 561,000 proteins (UniProt bank). Interestingly, the pattern was present in both human and bat the coronaviruses S proteins, in many proteins involved in coagulation process, cell–cell interaction, protein aggregation and regulation of cell fate, such as von Willebrand factor, coagulation factor X, fibronectin and Notch, characterized by the presence of the cysteine-rich EGF-like domain. This finding may suggest functional similarities between the matched proteins and the CoV-2 S protein, implying a new possible involvement of the S protein in the molecular mechanism that leads to the coagulopathy and cell fusion in COVID-19 disease.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Interfacial Water Many-body Effects Drive Structural Dynamics and Allosteric interactions in SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Dimerization Interface (preprint),"Following our previous work (Chem Sci , 2021, 12, 4889 – 4907), we study the structural dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease dimerization interface (apo dimer) by means of microsecond adaptive sampling molecular dynamics simulations (50 microseconds) using the AMOEBA polarizable force field (PFF) This interface is structured by a complex H-bond network that is only stable at physiological pH Structural correlations analysis between its residues and the catalytic site confirms the presence of a buried allosteric site However, noticeable differences in allosteric connectivity are observed between PFFs and non-PFFs Interfacial polarizable water molecules are shown to appear at the heart of this discrepancy, since they are connected to the global interface H-bond network and able to adapt their dipole moment (and dynamics) to their diverse local physico-chemical micro-environments The water-interface many-body interactions appear to drive the interface volume fluctuations and to therefore mediate the allosteric interactions with the catalytic cavity",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Vaccination and Immunity toward Measles: A Serosurvey in Future Healthcare Workers,"Measles is a very contagious infectious disease, and vaccination is the only medical aid to counter the spread of the infection The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of vaccination schedule and type of vaccine, number of doses, and sex on the immune response In a population of Italian medical students (8497 individuals born after 1980 with certificate of vaccination and quantitative measurement of antibodies against measles), the prevalence of positive antibodies to measles and antibody titer was measured Vaccination schedule such as number of doses and vaccine type (measles alone or combined as measles, mumps and rubella (MMR)) and sex were the variables considered to influence the immune response The vaccination schedule depends on the year of birth: students born before 1990 were prevalently vaccinated once and with measles vaccine alone (not as MMR) One dose of vaccine induces a significantly (p &lt; 0 0001) higher positive response and antibody titer than two doses, in particular when measles alone is used (p &lt; 0 0001) Females have a significantly higher percentage of positive response (p = 0 0001) than males but only when the MMR formulation was used Multiple linear regression confirms that sex significantly influences antibody titer when only MMR is used, after one (p = 0 0002) or two (p = 0 0060) doses In conclusion, vaccination schedule and, partially, sex influence immune response to measles vaccination Most notably, the measles vaccine alone (one dose) is more effective than one and two doses of MMR",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Optimising surgical training in the time of COVID-19 - Victorian regional teaching hospital experience.,"AIM Reductions in elective surgery due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a paralleled reduction in patient based surgical training opportunities. METHODS To quantify the impact of COVID-19 on surgical training, we completed a retrospective audit of the Urology Department activity during Victorian pandemic waves in 2020 at our large regional teaching hospital. Corresponding weeks in the year prior were used as the control. Interviews with department members illustrated the adaptive approach to surgical training used at our institution. RESULTS A State of Disaster Surgical Triage Team was assembled and surgical operations were split between one public and two private hospitals. A pandemic triaging protocol was established and 335 Category-2 patients were re-triaged. The first wave saw a 13.8% reduction in clinic reviews, with the second wave having an overall increase of 8.8% with 56% being telehealth. The second wave saw an 11.0% reduction in overall operating, with reduced emergency operating in both the first and second wave of 17.4% and 45.5% respectively. Reductions impacted surgical technical skill training, resulting in surgical education provided through technology platforms including webinars, podcasts and pre-recorded operative videos. The unique challenges trainees were faced with due to the pandemic encouraged development of non-technical RACS competencies. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic presented significant challenges for service delivery and training. Reduced direct patient contact and procedures, but opportunities to develop the non-technical skills required to respond to the pandemic. The use of variable educational opportunities and tools ensured our trainees continued to progress through their training.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Mental health indicators in Sweden over a 12-month period during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the lives of people globally and is expected to have profound effects on mental health. Yet, self-reported large-scale online surveys on mental health are still relatively uncommon. Here we aim to describe the mental health burden experienced in Sweden using baseline data of the Omtanke2020 Study. Method Self-reported baseline data collected over a 12-month period (June 9, 2020-June 8, 2021) from the longitudinal online survey of the Omtanke2020 Study including 27,950 adults in Sweden. Participants were volunteers or actively recruited through existing cohorts and after providing informed consent responded to monthly online questionnaires on socio-demographics, mental and physical health, COVID-19 infection, and impact. Poisson regression was fitted to assess the relative risk of high mental health burden (depression, anxiety, and COVID-19 specific PTSD). Result The overall proportion of persons with high level of symptoms was 15.6%, 9.5% and 24.5% for depression, anxiety, and COVID-19 specific PTSD, respectively. Overall, 43.4% of the participants had significant, clinically relevant symptoms for at least one mental health outcome and 7.3% had significant symptoms for all three outcomes. We also observed differences in the prevalence of these symptoms across strata of sex, age, recruitment type, COVID-19 status, region, and seasonality. Conclusion While the proportion of persons with high mental health burden remains higher than in pre-pandemic publications, our estimates are lower than previously reported levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD during the pandemic in Sweden and elsewhere.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Scoping Review Supporting decision-making on allocation of ICU beds and ventilators in pandemics,"As the world struggles with the COVID-19 pandemic, health service demands have increased to a point where healthcare resources may prove inadequate to meet demand. Guidelines and tools on how to best allocate intensive care beds and ventilators developed during previous epidemics can assist clinicians and policy-makers to make consistent, objective and ethically sounds decisions about resource allocation when healthcare rationing is inevitable. This scoping review of 62 published guidelines, triage protocols, consensus statements and prognostic tools from crisis and non-crisis situations sought to identify a multiplicity of objective factors to inform healthcare rationing of critical care and ventilator care. It also took ethical considerations into account. Prognostic indicators and other decision tools presented here can be combined to create locally-relevant triage algorithms for clinical services and policy makers deciding about allocation of ICU beds and ventilators during a pandemic. Community awareness of the triage protocol is recommended to build trust and alleviate anxiety among the public. This review provides a unique resource and is intended as a discussion starter for clinical services and policy makers to consider formalising an objective triage consensus document that fits the local context.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Dynamical characteristics of Covid-19 epidemic: Estimation from Colombia's case,"OBJECTIVES: To characterize the dynamics of the epidemic, for modeling purposes. METHODS: Data from Colombian official case information were collated for a period of five months. Dynamical parameters of the disease spread were then estimated from the data. Probability distribution models were identified that represent the time from symptom onset to hospitalization, to ICU admission and to death. Kaplan Meier estimates were also computed for the probability of eventually requiring hospitalization, needing ICU attention and of dying from the disease (the CFR). RESULTS: Probability distributions of the times and probabilities were computed for the population and for groups based on age and sex. Our results show that for the times that characterize the course of the disease for a given patient (to hospitalization, to ICU or death), the variation from an age group to another is very small (around of 10% of fixed effect intercept) and the effect of sex is even weaker (around 1%). The course of the disease appears to be very similar for all patients. The probability that a patient advances from one stage of the disease to another (to hospitalization, to ICU, to death), on the other hand, is heavily influenced by sex and age. Relative risk of death for males (based on 22924 dead) is 1.7. CONCLUSIONS: The times from one stage of the disease to another are almost independent of the major patient's variables (sex, age). This is in stark contrast to the probabilities of going from one stage to another which show a strong dependence on age and sex. Data also show that the length of hospital and ICU stays are almost independent of sex and age. The only factor that affects this length was the eventual outcome (survival or death) of the disease. The time is significantly longer for surviving patients.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Virtual Education During COVID-19: Exploring Factors Associated With E-Learning Satisfaction Among Saudi Nursing Students,"BACKGROUND: Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, education and learning processes have been shifted to a completely virtual, online format. Students' satisfaction has been linked to better learning outcomes. PURPOSE: The purpose was to determine factors associated with students' satisfaction with e-learning among Saudi nursing students. METHODS: A cross-sectional, correlational descriptive study was conducted among 139 nursing students from different nursing programs in Saudi Arabia using a self-reported online survey. RESULTS: Previous experience with and readiness for e-learning influenced students' overall satisfaction with e-learning and satisfaction with assessment. Only readiness for e-learning was associated with satisfaction with teaching and generic skills and learning experiences. CONCLUSIONS: This study may enhance faculty members' understandings of factors influencing students' satisfaction with e-learning.

Media portrayal of mental health at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic games,"Introduction: The media coverage of high-profile sporting events can bring increased pressure to athletes' psychological wellbeing. There may be speculation regarding athletes' mental state before, during and after competition potentially impacting on both the athlete's wellbeing and public perception of the individual if a negative tone is attached to an article. As mental health understanding and literacy develop, media reporting of elite athlete mental health may contribute to shaping of opinions and help seeking behaviour. Thus, we have aimed to understand and analyse the tone and content of media reporting on a high-profile sporting event using qualitative methods to explore key aspects of the articles sampled. Methods: We selected two UK broadsheet newspapers available online (The Guardian and The Telegraph) and identified all text articles including the terms ""Mental Health"" and ""Olympics"" or ""Paralympics"" published between 23rd July 2019 and 30th November 2021. We selected articles relevant to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games and including mental health as a subject. Relevant articles were read in full, and we conducted a thematic analysis to explore how mental health was portrayed. Results: 581 results were generated from our initial search. Following screening and removal of irrelevant articles, we had 95 articles for analysis. We identified four themes relating to portrayal of mental health: Pressure, impact of COVID, Lack of specific diagnostic terms, and athletes as humans. Conclusion: Media portrayal of mental health at the Tokyo Games was generally positive and portrayed athletes as relatable, inspiring, and ""human"" rather than superhuman. Reporting particularly focused on athlete-specific factors in mental health conditions and the pressures of high-level competition.

"TET2 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia: a comprehensive study in patients of Sindh, Pakistan.","Background The tet oncogene family member 2 (TET2) gene has been reported to be involved in DNA methylation and epigenetic regulation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Various studies have proven functional role of TET2 mutations in AML. We herein studied the frequency and genotype-phenotype correlation of TET2 gene in AML patients in Sindh, Pakistan. Patients and methods The current study was carried out at Liaquat University of Medical & Health Sciences, Jamshoro, Pakistan, in collaboration with National Institute of Blood Disease & Bone Marrow Transplant, Karachi, Pakistan, during the period from June 2019 to June 2020. A total of 130 patients diagnosed with AML were screened for TET2 mutations. Whole exome sequencing of 14 individuals was carried out to find the genetic variants in TET2 gene. The pathogenicity of the variants was predicted by SIFT, PolyPhen2, Mutation Taster and CADD Phred scores. The allele frequency of the variants was compared with global population using 1000 genomes project and Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). Furthermore, exon 3 and exon 5 of the TET2 gene were sequenced by using Sanger sequencing. The findings were correlated with subtypes of AML and corresponding karyotypes. Results Through the exome sequencing, 17 genetic variants (13 SNPs and four indels) were identified in 14 individuals. Of these, four variants that is, one frameshift deletion, one frameshift insertion and two nonsense variants were novel and not present in dbSNP151 database. Three novel variants were found in exon 3 including two frameshift variants that is, p.T395fs and G494fs, predicted as deleterious by CADD Phred scores, and one stop-gain variant (p.G898X) predicted as deleterious by Mutation Taster and CADD Phred scores. One novel non sense variant (p.Q1191X) was found in the exon 5 predicted as deleterious by SIFT, Mutation Taster and CADD Phred scores. Sanger sequencing analysis revealed one novel deletion at g105233851: del.TAGATAGA, and one novel SNP g;105233861 T>G identified in the TET2 gene. Majority of the exon 3 mutations were seen in the patients diagnosed with AML with maturation, and had a normal karyotype. Conclusion TET2 mutations were identified in around 16% of the total patients of our study indicating other mechanisms being involved in pathophysiology of AML in this cohort. The TET2 mutations provide a prognostic value in determining AML classification.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Community assets and multimorbidity: A qualitative scoping study,"Little is known of how community assets can play a role in multimorbidity care provision. Using a rapid ethnographic approach, the study explored perceptions of the role of community assets in how multimorbidity is managed within Southwark and Lambeth in Southeast London, England. The scoping work comprised of four micro-studies covering (1) Rapid review of the literature (2) Documentary analysis of publicly available local policy documents (3) Thematic analysis of community stories and (4) Semi-structured stakeholder interviews. The data were analysed using framework thematic analysis. Themes are presented for each of the microstudies. The literature review analysis highlights the role of attitudes and understandings in the management of multiple long-term conditions and the need to move beyond silos in their management. Documentary analysis identifies a resource poor climate, whilst recognising the role of community assets and solution-focussed interventions in the management of multimorbidity. Community patient stories underline the lack of joined up care, and psychosocial issues such as the loss of control and reducing isolation. The stakeholder interview analysis reveals again a sense of disjointed care, the need for holism in the understanding and treatment of multimorbidity, whilst recognising the important role of community-based approaches, beyond the biomedical model. Recommendations stemming from the study’s findings are proposed. Upholding access to and resourcing community assets have key practical importance.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Initiating Antidepressant Medication: What is the Most Important Factor?,"Treatment initiation is arguably the most important step in the management of depression. It is important at this stage of treatment to establish a therapeutic partnership between physician and patient, to facilitate shared decision-making. With specific regard to pharmacotherapy, negative attitudes and beliefs about antidepressant medications are common among the general public, and these can impact on how physicians who prescribe antidepressant medication are viewed. Some of these beliefs are that antidepressants are addictive, and that they change an individual's personality. Before initiating treatment, it is important for physicians to understand the patient's attitudes towards treatment, as well as their goals for treatment, especially since the patient's goals may not be the same as the physician's. Physicians can also identify patients who may be at risk of treatment resistance-those with more severe symptoms, at risk of suicide, with higher number of lifetime depressive episodes and comorbid anxiety disorder-and to differentiate treatment resistance from overlapping comorbidities. Patients need to understand that depression results from an interaction between biological and environmental factors; the use of analogies with other diseases, such as hypertension and/or a broken leg, can help in this regard. Finally, patients can be reassured that antidepressant medication is effective, and the range of agents currently available today target multiple pathways. While monotherapy is the goal, some patients will require additional treatments to manage comorbid psychiatric conditions (e.g. anxiety) or to achieve complete remission of depression. Only through complete remission of symptoms do patients achieve a level of psychosocial functioning that is equivalent to the non-depressed population. By explaining these factors to the patient, and listening to the patient's beliefs, fears and goals, physicians can forge an effective therapeutic partnership for shared decision-making and maximise the chances of success from the time of treatment initiation.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

DIGITISATION of the CHARITY SECTOR: UNRAVELLING the TENSIONS of the DIGITAL VERSUS the REALITY,"Due to Covid-19, many charities have had to rapidly adapt their face-to-face services and transition to using digital platforms. This digitisation of services has led to the concept of Digitally Enhanced Advanced Services (DEAS), a model of servitisation applied in the manufacturing sector, being discussed in relation to the charity sector. This paper examines the applicability of DEAS to the charity sector. It explores how trust, resilience and privacy are addressed in co-creating digital platforms as well as the sustainability of digital services. Using the Refugee Council Children's Section as a case study, a mixed methods approach was applied including data mining, participant observation, and semi-structured interviews with 10 practitioners and service users. Findings show that there exists a tension between the digital and the reality in the charity sector: digital services increase access to service users in remote areas but digital poverty and illiteracy remain significant obstacles for digital servitisation. Resilience and adaptability have enabled the charity sector to operate inside the tension between the digital and reality. The adoption of DEAS in the charity sector will be dependent upon maximising opportunities, implementing changes, and overcoming barriers. © 2021 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

Diversity of Cardiac and Gastrointestinal Presentations of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) Associated with COVID-19: A Case Series,"COVID-19 is generally a benign or asymptomatic infection in children, but can occasionally be severe or fatal. Delayed presentation of COVID-19 with hyperinflammation and multi-organ involvement was recently recognized, designated the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). Six children with MIS-C with molecular and serologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted to our hospital between May 5, 2020 and June 25, 2020. All had fever and weakness; 4/6 presented with gastrointestinal symptoms. Two children had features of complete Kawasaki disease, 3 had incomplete Kawasaki disease, while 1 had terminal ileitis with delayed onset of circulatory shock. Treatment consisted of intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin for Kawasaki-like disease. Remdesivir, corticosteroids, and infliximab were used when indicated. Median hospitalization was 7 days. Immediate treatment resulted in rapid clinical improvement. In children presenting with hyperinflammatory syndromes without cardiac manifestations, testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies, with close cardiac monitoring should be pursued due to the manifold presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Principles and Challenges in anti-COVID-19 Vaccine Development,"The number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected patients keeps rising in most of the European countries despite the pandemic precaution measures. The current antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapeutic approaches are only supportive, have limited efficacy, and the prevention in reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus is the best hope for public health. It is presumed that an effective vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection could mobilize the innate and adaptive immune responses and provide a protection against severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease. As the race for the effective and safe vaccine has begun, different strategies were introduced. To date, viral vector-based vaccines, genetic vaccines, attenuated vaccines, and protein-based vaccines are the major vaccine types tested in the clinical trials. Over 80 clinical trials have been initiated; however, only 18 vaccines have reached the clinical phase II/III or III, and 4 vaccine candidates are under consideration or have been approved for the use so far. In addition, the protective effect of the off-target vaccines, such as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin and measles vaccine, is being explored in randomized prospective clinical trials with SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. In this review, we discuss the most promising anti-COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials and different vaccination strategies in order to provide more clarity into the ongoing clinical trials.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
COVID-19 Is an Independent Risk Factor for Acute Ischemic Stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an active worldwide pandemic with diverse complications. Stroke as a presentation has not been strongly associated with COVID-19. The authors aimed to retrospectively review a link between COVID-19 and acute stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study of 41 cases and 82 control subjects matched by age, sex, and risk factors. Cases were patients who underwent stroke alert imaging with confirmed acute stroke on imaging between March 16 and April 5, 2020, at 6 hospitals across New York City. Control subjects were those who underwent stroke alertimaging during the same timeframe without imaging evidence of acute infarction. Data pertaining to diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, patient demographics, and risk factors were collected. A univariate analysis was performed to assess the covariate effect of risk factors and COVID-19 status on stroke imaging with positive findings. RESULTS: The mean age for cases and controls was 65.5 ± 15.3 years and 68.8 ± 13.2 years, respectively. Of patients with acute ischemic stroke, 46.3% had COVID-19 infection compared with 18.3% of controls (P = .001). After adjusting for age, sex, and risk factors, COVID-19 infection had a significant independent association with acute ischemic stroke compared with control subjects (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.7-8.9; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that COVID-19 infection is significantly associated with imaging confirmation of acute ischemic stroke, and patients with COVID-19 should undergo more aggressive monitoring for stroke.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Single Extracellular Vesicles (EV) Proteomic Profiling Altered and Identifies Co-Localization of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein with CD81/Integrin-Rich EV Subpopulation in Sputum Samples of COVID-19 Patients,"In response to the present coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is important to understand the infection pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Sputum samples from 20 COVID-19 patients and healthy controls were collected, respectively. During the isolation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus, exosome-like vesicles were found associated with virions under transmission electron microscope. Next, the expression of IL6 and TGF-β increased in exosomes derived from the sputum of patients, and these were highly correlated with the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Further, proximity barcoding assay (PBA) was used to investigate the immune related proteins in the exosomes, as well as the relationship between exosomes and SARS-CoV-2 N protein in COVID-19 patients’ samples. Particularly, to investigate the differential contribution of the specific exosome subsets, the protein expression of a single exosome was detected and analyzed for the first time. Among the 40 exosome subpopulations, 18 were found to have significant differences. The exosome subpopulation regulated by CD81 were most likely to correlate with the changes in the pulmonary microenvironment after SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study provides evidence on the association between exosomes and SARS-CoV-2 virus and promotes our understanding on possible pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Funding Statement: This work is supported by the emergency grants for prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 of Ministry of Guangdong province (2020B111133001), the China Postdoctoral Science Project (2020T130025ZX and 2019M652860), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC1304101), the Independent project of the State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases (SKLRD-QN-201913), and the Local Innovative and Research Teams Project of Guangdong Pearl River Talents Program (2017BT01S155).Declaration of Interests: The authors have declared that no conflict of interest exists.Ethics Approval Statement: The present study obtained the approval of the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (Guangzhou, China).",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
Methodology and application of Escherichia coli F4 and F18 encoding infection models in post-weaning pigs,"The enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) expressing F4 and F18 fimbriae are the two main pathogens associated with post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) in piglets. The growing global concern regarding antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has encouraged research into the development of nutritional and feeding strategies as well as vaccination protocols in order to counteract the PWD due to ETEC. A valid approach to researching effective strategies is to implement piglet in vivo challenge models with ETEC infection. Thus, the proper application and standardization of ETEC F4 and F18 challenge models represent an urgent priority. The current review provides an overview regarding the current piglet ETEC F4 and F18 challenge models; it highlights the key points for setting the challenge protocols and the most important indicators which should be included in research studies to verify the effectiveness of the ETEC challenge. Based on the current review, it is recommended that the setting of the model correctly assesses the choice and preconditioning of pigs, and the timing and dosage of the ETEC inoculation. Furthermore, the evaluation of the ETEC challenge response should include both clinical parameters (such as the occurrence of diarrhea, rectal temperature and bacterial fecal shedding) and biomarkers for the specific expression of ETEC F4/F18 (such as antibody production, specific F4/F18 immunoglobulins (Igs), ETEC F4/F18 fecal enumeration and analysis of the F4/F18 receptors expression in the intestinal brush borders). On the basis of the review, the piglets’ response upon F4 or F18 inoculation differed in terms of the timing and intensity of the diarrhea development, on ETEC fecal shedding and in the piglets’ immunological antibody response. This information was considered to be relevant to correctly define the experimental protocol, the data recording and the sample collections. Appropriate challenge settings and evaluation of the response parameters will allow future research studies to comply with the replacement, reduction and refinement (3R) approach, and to be able to evaluate the efficiency of a given feeding, nutritional or vaccination intervention in order to combat ETEC infection.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title
"Persistence, Magnitude and Patterns of Post-acute Symptoms and Quality of Life Following Onset of SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Cohort Description and Approaches for Measurement","BACKGROUND: There is mounting evidence for the presence of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), but there is limited information on the spectrum, magnitude, duration, and patterns of these sequelae as well as their influence on quality of life. METHODS: We assembled a cohort of adults with documented history of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positivity who were ≥ 2 weeks past onset of COVID-19 symptoms or, if asymptomatic, first positive test. At 4-month intervals, we queried physical and mental health symptoms and quality of life. RESULTS: Of the first 179 participants enrolled, 10 were asymptomatic during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 125 symptomatic but not hospitalized, and 44 symptomatic and hospitalized. During the post-acute phase, fatigue, shortness of breath, concentration problems, headaches, trouble sleeping and anosmia/dysgeusia were most common through 8 months of observation. Symptoms were typically at least somewhat bothersome and sometimes exhibited a waxing-and-waning course. Some participants experienced symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress, as well as difficulties with performance of usual activities. The median visual analogue scale rating of general health was lower at 4 and 8 months compared to pre-COVID-19. Two clusters of symptom domains were identified. CONCLUSION: Many participants report bothersome symptoms following onset of COVID-19 with variable patterns of persistence and impact on quality of life. The substantial variability suggests the existence of multiple sub-phenotypes of PASC. A rigorous approach to the prospective measurement of symptoms and functional manifestations sets the stage for the next phase of research focusing on the pathophysiologic causes of the various sub-groups of PASC.",Please summerize the given abstract to a title

Physical Function in Critically Ill Patients during the Duration of ICU and Hospital Admission,"BACKGROUND: Impaired physical activity and functional ability is a significant problem in critical illness survivors. Measurement of physical functioning through intensive care unit (ICU) stay determines patients at risk of poor physical outcomes, monitors efficacy of intervention, and informs recovery trajectories. OBJECTIVES: Study objective was to assess physical function trajectory and identify residual functional limitations in critically ill patients admitted to ICU at the point of discharge from the hospital using robust clinical measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following ethical approval, 100 patients (78 males and 22 females) admitted to medical and surgical ICUs were recruited. Scores on Functional Status Score in ICU (FSS-ICU), Physical Function ICU Test (PFIT), and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) were recorded. Day of physiotherapy reference in the ICU was considered as day of ICU admission. Data were collected at three points, namely ICU admission, ICU discharge, and hospital discharge.
